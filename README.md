# Smart-Inventory-Shortage-Prediction-Suite

This project predicts supply shortages using a combination of LSTM, XGBoost, and hybrid models, tailored to handle highly imbalanced datasets. It also features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that offers real-time, context-aware insights into shortage causes.
