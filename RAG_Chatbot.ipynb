On the academic side, it should be appropriate for MBA students, engineering master's stu\\xaddents, and senior undergraduate students interested in supply chain management and logistics. It should also serve as a suitable reference for both concepts as well as methodology for practitioners in consulting and industry. \\nThe book has grown from a course on supply chain management taught to second\\xadyear MBA students at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern \\nUniversity. The goal of this class was to cover not only high-level supply chain strat\\xadegy and concepts, but also to give students a solid understanding of the analytical \\ntools necessary to solve supply chain problems. With this class goal in mind, our objec\\xadtive was to create a book that would develop an understanding of the following key areas and their interrelationships: \\n• The strategic role of a supply chain \\n• The key strategic drivers of supply chain performance \\n• Analytic methodologies for supply chain analysis \\nOur first objective in this book is for the reader to learn the strategic importance of good supply chain design, planning, and operation for every firm. The reader will be able to understand how good supply chain management can be a competitive advan\\xadtage, whereas weaknesses in the supply chain can hurt the performance of a firm. We use many examples to illustrate this idea and develop a framework for supply chain strategy. \\nWithin the strategic framework, we identify facilities, inventory, transportation, \\ninformation, sourcing, and pricing as the key drivers of supply chain performance. \\nOur second goal in the book is to convey how these drivers may be used on a con\\xadceptual and practical level during supply chain design, planning, and operation to improve performance. We have included a case on Seven-Eleven Japan that can be used to illustrate how the company uses various drivers to improve supply chain performance. For each driver of supply chain performance, our goal is to provide readers with practical managerial levers and concepts that may be used to improve supply chain performance. \\nUtilizing these managerial levers requires knowledge of analytic methodologies \\nfor supply chain analysis. Our third goal is to give the reader an understanding of these methodologies. Every methodological discussion is illustrated with its application in Excel. In this discussion, we also stress the managerial context in which they are used and the managerial levers for improvement that they support. \\nThe strategic frameworks and concepts discussed in the book are tied together through a variety of examples that show how a combination of concepts is needed to achieve significant increases in performance. \\nxiii\"),\n",

Both sourcing and pricing were covered in the earlier editions, but \\nwe felt that the framework was more complete with each being considered as a \\ndriver. The supply chain drivers are a structure that appears throughout the book, \\nso making this change-and thus changing much of the structure of the book-is, we \\nbelieve, a major improvement. As supply chain management has become more and \\nmore about relationships among different enterprises in the supply chain, we feel it \\nis only natural to include these two new drivers that encompass significant processes \\nwith both upstream and downstream supply chain partners. \\n• Along with the expansion of the supply chain drivers comes a fuller treatment of \\nthe two new drivers, sourcing and pricing. The chapters on sourcing and pricing \\nhave increased depth, with particular emphasis on improvement and expansion of \\nthe sourcing chapter. Included in this expansion are new discussions on such \\nimportant issues as how to determine whether to perform functions in-house or \\nto outsource them as well as discussion of the services offered by various types of \\nlogistics providers. This adds a great deal of richness to the discussion of our new \\ndrivers, which we believe is necessary given their importance in the supply chain. \\nSupply chain metrics are crucial in monitoring a supply chain's performance and in \\nhelping to improve that performance. \\n• To this end, we have added a significant section to Chapter 3 on supply chain metrics. \\nWithout supply chain metrics, it is very difficult to implement supply chain changes \\neffectively. With this new material, we hope readers will come away with an under\\xad\\nstanding of what ought to be measured and why it is important to do so. These \\nmetrics show up in the following chapters as we discuss each driver, so the reader \\ncan understand the importance of using the metric and how the metric can be \\nimproved. \\nIn the previous editions, we combined virtually all of our discussion of the use of \\ninformation technology into a chapter with that specific focus. \\n• We still have an IT chapter in this edition, but we have made a significant change \\nby adding IT-focused sections within individual chapters that address IT issues \\nspecific to the realm on which the particular chapter focuses. We believe this \\nmore integrated view of IT better portrays the importance of IT and its perme\\xad\\nation through virtually all supply chain functions. \\n• Similar to the IT sections within many of the chapters, we have also added sec\\xad\\ntions in many chapters focused on supply chain risk. In the past, we mentioned \\nsupply chain risk in various discussions, but we believe it is such an important \\ntopic that it deserves more attention than it received. As with the IT sections, \\neach risk section is focused on risk factors pertaining to the topic on which the \\nchapter focuses, thus giving readers a more integrated view of all factors affecting \\ndecisions within the area of the chapter topic. \\n• We have also moved the content from the e-business chapter into other chapters, \\nmost notably into Chapter 4 on distribution networks. As before, we believe this \\npresents a more integrated view of the supply chain issues one must grapple with \\nand thus is a worthwhile change. \\n-~--- ------------·-----·---·-----.--\"),\n",

Discuss the goal of a supply chain and explain the impact of supply chain decisions on the \\nsuccess of a firm. \\n2. Identify the three key supply chain decision phases and explain the significance of each one. \\n3. Describe the cycle and push/pull views of a supply chain. \\n4. Classify the supply chain macro processes in a firm. \\nI\\nn this chapter, we provide a conceptual understanding of what a supply chain is and \\nthe various issues that need to be considered when designing, planning, or operating \\na supply chain. We discuss the significance of supply chain decisions and supply chain \\nperformance for the success of a firm. We also provide several examples from different \\nindustries to emphasize the variety of supply chain issues that companies need to con\\xad\\nsider at the strategic, planning, and operational levels. \\n1.1 WHAT IS A SUPPLY CHAIN? \\nA supply chain consists of all parties involved, directly or indirectly, in fulfilling a cus\\xad\\ntomer request. The supply chain includes not only the manufacturer and suppliers, but \\nalso transporters, warehouses, retailers, and even customers themselves. Within each \\norganization, such as a manufacturer, the supply chain includes all functions involved \\nin receiving and filling a customer request. These functions include, but are not limited \\nto, new product development, marketing, operations, distribution, finance, and cus\\xad\\ntomer service. \\nConsider a customer walking into a Wal-Mart store to purchase detergent. The \\nsupply chain begins with the customer and his or her need for detergent. The next stage \\nof this supply chain is the Wal-Mart retail store that the customer visits. Wal-Mart \\nstocks its shelves using inventory that may have been supplied from a finished-goods \\nwarehouse or a distributor using trucks supplied by a third partx. The distributor in \\nturn is stocked by the manufacturer (say, Proctor & Gamble [P&G] in this case). The \\nP&G manufacturing plant receives raw material from a variety of suppliers, who may \\nthemselves have been supplied by lower-tier suppliers. For example, packaging mater\\xad\\nial may come from Tenneco packaging, while Tenneco receives raw materials to manu\\xad\\nfacture the packaging from other suppliers. This supply chain is illustrated in Figure 1-1, \\nwith the arrows corresponding to the direction of physical product flow.'),\n",

Tenneco \\nCompany Manufacturer Packaging \\n~ \\nP&G or Other Wal-Mart Wal-Mart \\n~ Manufacturer \\nf+ or Third f+ Store f+ Customer \\nParty DC \\nChemical ~ Plastic V \\nManufacturer Producer \\nA supply chain is dynamic and involves the constant flow of information, product, \\nand funds between different stages. In our example, Wal-Mart provides the product, as \\nwell as pricing and availability information, to the customer. The customer transfers \\nfunds to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart conveys point-of-sales data as well as replenishment \\norders to the warehouse or distributor, who transfers the replenishment order via \\ntrucks back to the store. Wal-Mart transfers funds to the distributor after the replen\\xad\\nishment. The distributor also provides pricing information and sends delivery sched\\xad\\nules to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart may send back packaging material to be recycled. Similar \\ninformation, material, and fund flows take place across the entire supply chain. \\nIn another example, when a customer makes a purchase online from Dell \\nComputer, the supply chain includes, among others, the customer, Dell's Web site, the \\nDell assembly plant, and all of Dell's suppliers and their suppliers. The Web site pro\\xad\\nvides the customer with information regarding pricing, product variety, and product \\navailability. Having made a product choice, the customer enters the order information \\nand pays for the product. The customer may later return to the Web site to check the \\nstatus of the order. Stages farther up the supply chain use customer order information \\nto fill the request. That process involves an additional flow of information, product, and \\nfunds between various stages of the supply chain. \\nThese examples illustrate that the customer is an integral part of the supply chain. \\nIn fact, the primary purpose of any supply chain is to satisfy customer needs and, in the \\nprocess, generate profit for itself. The term supply chain conjures up images of product \\nor supply moving from suppliers to manufacturers to distributors to retailers to cus\\xad\\ntomers along a chain. This is certainly part of the supply chain, but it is also important \\nto visualize information, funds, and product flows along both directions of this chain. \\nThe term supply chain may also imply that only one player is involved at each stage. In \\nreality, a manufacturer may receive material from several suppliers and then supply \\nseveral distributors. Thus, most supply chains are actually networks. It may be more \\naccurate to use the term supply network or supply web to describe the structure of \\nmost supply chains, as shown in Figure 1-2. \\nA typical supply chain may involve a variety of stages. These supply chain stages \\ninclude: \\n• Customers \\n• Retailers\"),\n",

These flows often occur in both directions and may be managed by one of \\nthe stages or an intermediary. Each stage in Figure 1-2 need not be present in a supply \\nchain. The appropriate design of the supply chain depends on both the customer's \\nneeds and the roles played by the stages involved. In some cases, such as Dell, a manu\\xad\\nfacturer may fill customer orders directly. Dell builds-to-order; that is, a customer \\norder initiates manufacturing at Dell.

In other cases, such as the mail-order company L.L.Bean, \\nmanufacturers do not respond to customer orders directly. In this case, L.L.Bean main\\xad\\ntains an inventory of product from which it fills customer orders. Compared to the Dell \\nsupply chain, the L.L.Bean supply chain contains an extra stage (the retailer, L.L.Bean \\nitself) between the customer and the manufacturer. In the case of other retail stores, \\nthe supply chain may also contain a wholesaler or distributor between· the store and \\nthe manufacturer. \\n1.2 THE OBJECTIVE OF A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nThe objective of every supply chain should be to maximize the overall value generated. \\nThe value a supply chain generates is the difference between what the final product is \\nworth to the customer and the costs the supply chain incurs in filling the customer's \\nrequest. For most commercial supply chains, value will be strongly correlated with \\nsupply chain profitability (also known as supply chain surplus), the difference between \\nthe revenue generated from the customer and the overall cost across the supply chain. \\nFor example, a customer purchasing a wireless router from Best Buy pays $60, which \\nrepresents the revenue the supply chain receives. Best Buy and other stages of the sup\\xad\\nply chain incur costs to convey information, produce components, store them, transport \\nthem, transfer funds, and so on. The difference between the $60 that the customer paid \\nand the sum of all costs incurred by the supply chain to produce and distribute the \\nrouter represents the supply chain profitability or surplus.

Supply \\nchain success should be measured in terms of supply chain profitability and not in terms \\nof the profits at an individual stage. (In subsequent chapters we see that a focus on prof\\xad\\nitability at individual stages may lead to a reduction in overall supply chain profits.) \\nHaving defined the success of a supply chain in terms of supply chain profitability, \\nthe next logical step is to look for sources of revenue and cost. For any supply chain, \\nthere is only one source of revenue: the customer. At Wal-Mart, a customer purchasing \\ndetergent is the only one providing positive cash flow for the supply chain. All other \\ncash flows are simply fund exchanges that occur within the supply chain, given that dif\\xad\\nferent stages have different owners. When Wal-Mart pays its supplier, it is taking a por\\xad\\ntion of the funds the customer provides and passing that money on to the supplier. All \\nflows of information, product, or funds generate costs within the supply chain. Thus, the \\nappropriate management of these flows is a key to supply chain success. Effective \\nsupply chain management involves the management of supply chain assets and prod\\xad\\nuct, information, and fund flows to maximize total supply chain profitability. \\nIn this book we will have a strong focus on analyzing all supply chain decisions in \\nterms of their impact on the supply chain surplus. These decisions and their impact can \\nvary for a wide variety of reasons. For instance, consider the difference in the supply \\nchain structure for fast-moving consumer goods observed in the United States and India. \\nU.S. distributors play a much smaller role in this supply chain compared to their Indian \\ncounterparts. We argue that the difference in supply chain structure can be explained by \\nthe impact a distributor has on the supply chain surplus in the two countries. \\nRetailing in the United States is largely consolidated, with large chains buying con\\xad\\nsumer goods from most manufacturers. This consolidation gives retailers sufficient \\nscale that the introduction of an intermediary such as a distributor does little to reduce \\ncosts and may actually increase costs because of an additional transaction. In contrast, \\nIndia has millions of small retail outlets. The small size of Indian retail outlets limits the \\namount of inventory they can hold, thus requiring frequent replenishment-an order \\ncan be compared with the weekly grocery shopping for a family in the United States. \\nThe only way for a manufacturer to keep transportation costs low is to bring full \\ntruckloads of product close to the market and then distribute locally using \"milk runs\" \\nwith smaller vehicles. The presence of an intermediary who can receive a full truck\\xad\\nload shipment, break bulk, and then make smaller deliveries to the retailers is crucial \\nif transportation costs are to be kept low. Most Indian distributors are one-stop shops, \\nstocking everything from cooking oil to soaps and detergents made by a variety of \\nmanufacturers. Besides the convenience provided by one-stop shopping, distributors in \\nIndia are also able to reduce transportation costs for outbound delivery to the retailer \\nby aggregating products across multiple manufacturers during the delivery runs. \\nDistributors in India also handle collections, because their cost of collection is signifi\\xad\\ncantly lower than each manufacturer collecting from retailers on its own. Thus, the \\nimportant role of distributors in India can be explained by the growth in supply chain \\nsurplus that results from their presence. The supply chain surplus argument implies \\nthat as retailing in India begins to consolidate, the role of distributors will diminish. \\n1.3 THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPLY CHAIN DECISIONS \\nThere is a close connection between the design and management of supply chain \\nflows (product, information, and funds) and the success of a supply chain.

In \\ncontrast, the failure of many e-businesses such as Webvan can be attributed to \\nweaknesses in their supply chain design and planning. Similarly, Quaker Oats's \\nacquisition of Snapple in 1994 is an example of how the inability to design and man\\xad\\nage supply chain flows effectively led to failure. We discuss these examples later in \\nthis section. \\nWal-Mart has been a leader at using supply chain design, planning, and operation \\nto achieve success. From its beginning, the company invested heavily in transportation \\nand information infrastructure to facilitate the effective flow of goods and information. \\nWal-Mart designed its supply chain with clusters of stores around distribution centers \\nto facilitate frequent replenishment at its retail stores in a cost-effective manner. \\nFrequent replenishment allows stores to match supply and demand more effectively \\nthan the competition. Wal-Mart has been a leader in sharing information and collabo\\xad\\nrating with suppliers to bring down costs and improve product availability. The results \\nare impressive. In their 2004 annual report, the company reported a net income of \\nmore than $9 billion on revenues of about $250 billion. These are dramatic results for a \\ncompany that reached annual sales of only $1 billion in 1980. The growth in sales rep\\xad\\nresents an annual compounded growth rate of 26 percent. \\nDell has, over a relatively short period of time, become the world's largest personal \\ncomputer (PC) manufacturer. In 2004 Dell had a net income of over $2.6 billion on \\nrevenues of just over $41 billion. The company has attributed a significant part of its \\nsuccess to the way it manages flows-product, information, and funds-within its sup\\xad\\nply chain. \\nDell bypasses distributors and retailers and sells directly to customers. Close con\\xad\\ntact with its customers and an understanding of customers' needs allow Dell to develop \\nbetter forecasts. To further improve the match between supply and demand, Dell \\nmakes an active effort to steer customers in real time, on the phone or via the Internet, \\ntoward PC configurations that can be built given the components available. \\nOn the operational side, Dell centralizes manufacturing and inventories in a few \\nlocations and postpones final assembly until orders arrive. As a result, Dell is able to \\nprovide a large variety of PC configurations while keeping very low levels of inventory. \\nIn 2004, Dell carried less than five days' worth of inventory; in contrast, the competi\\xad\\ntion, selling through retailers, carries several weeks' worth of inventory. If Intel intro\\xad\\nduces a new chip, the low level of inventory allows Dell to go to market with a PC \\ncontaining the chip faster than the competition. If prices drop suddenly, as they often \\ndo, Dell has less inventory that loses value relative to its competitors. For some prod\\xad\\nucts, such as monitors manufactured by Sony, Dell maintains no inventory. The trans\\xad\\nportation company simply picks up the appropriate number of computers from Dell's \\nAustin, Texas, plant and monitors from Sony's factory in Mexico, matches them by cus\\xad\\ntomer order, and delivers them to the customers. This procedure allows Dell to save \\ntime and money associated with the extra handling of monitors. \\nThe success of the Dell supply chain is facilitated by sophisticated information \\nexchange. Dell provides real-time data to suppliers on the current state of demand. \\nSuppliers are able to access their components' inventory levels at the factories along \\nwith daily production requirements. Dell has created customized Web pages for its \\nmajor suppliers to view demand forecasts and other customer-sensitive information, \\nthus helping suppliers to get a better idea of customer demand and better match their \\nproduction schedules to that of Dell. \\nDell's low levels of inventory also help ensure that defects are not introduced into \\na large quantity of products. When a new product is launched, supplier engineers are \\nstationed right in the plant. If a customer calls in with a problem, production can be\"),\n",

As there is no finished product in inventory, the \\namount of defective merchandise produced is minimized. \\nDell also manages its cash flows very effectively. By managing inventories, receiv\\xad\\nables, and payables very closely, it managed a cash conversion cycle of negative 36 days \\nin 2004. In other words, Dell ran its business on other people's money! \\nClearly, Dell's supply chain design and its management of product, information, \\nand cash flows play a key role in the company's success. In the changing markc;tplace, \\nhowever, the company's supply chain design presents some new challenges for Dell. \\nWhereas it has a supply chain that is very well suited to provide a high degree of cus\\xad\\ntomization at a low cost, it is not clear that hardware customization will stay significant \\nfor PCs and other products that Dell sells. In the future, Dell may have to rethink its \\nsupply chain design to maintain success. \\nThe failure of many e-businesses such as Webvan and Kozmo can be attributed to \\ntheir inability to design appropriate supply chains or manage supply chain flows \\neffectively. Webvan designed a supply chain with large warehouses in several major \\ncities in the United States, from which groceries were delivered to customer homes. \\nThis supply chain design could not compete with traditional supermarket supply chains \\nin terms of cost. Traditional supermarket chains bring product to a supermarket close \\nto the consumer using full truckloads, resulting in very low transportation costs. They \\nturn their inventory relatively fast and let the customer perform most of the picking \\nactivity in the store. In contrast, Webvan turned its inventory marginally faster than \\nsupermarkets but incurred much higher transportation costs for home delivery and \\nhigh labor costs to pick customer orders. The result was a company that folded in 2001 \\nwithin two years of a very successful initial public offering. \\nQuaker Oats, with its acquisition of Snapple, provides another example in which \\nfailure to design and manage supply chain flows led to financial failure. In December \\n1994, Quaker Oats purchased Snapple, a producer of bottled natural drinks such as \\nteas, at a cost of $1.7 billion. Gatorade, the top-selling brand in the sports drink seg\\xad\\nment, was Quaker Oats's most successful beverage. Gatorade was very strong in the \\nSouth and Southwest of the United States, whereas Snapple was strong in the \\nNortheast and on the West Coast. \\nQuaker Oats announced that a major motivation of the merger was the potential \\nsynergies between the two distribution systems of Snapple and Gatorade. The com\\xad\\npany, however, was unable to take advantage of these synergies. Problems stemmed \\nfrom causes such as disparate manufacturing facilities and different customer types. \\nGatorade was manufactured in plants owned by Quaker Oats, whereas Snapple was \\nproduced under contract by outside plants. Gatorade sold significant amounts through \\nsupermarkets and grocery stores, whereas Snapple sold primarily through restaurants \\nand independent retailers. Over the two years following its acquisition of Snapple, \\nQuaker Oats was unable to gain much synergy between the two distribution systems in \\nits attempts to merge them. Just 28 months later, Quaker Oats sold Snapple to Triarc \\nCompanies for about $300 million, about 20 percent of the purchase price. The inabil\\xad\\nity to achieve synergies between the two supply chains was a significant reason for the \\nfailure of Snapple for Quaker Oats. \\n'' _- _, \\n-, -\\nt(ev· ..

Each decision should be made to raise the supply \\nchain surplus. These decisions fall into three categories or phases, depending on the fre\\xad\\nquency of each decision and the time frame during which a decision phase has an \\nimpact. As a result, each category of decisions must consider uncertainty over the deci\\xad\\nsion horizon. \\n1. Supply Chain Strategy or Design: During this phase, given the marketing and pric\\xad\\ning plans for a product, a company decides how to structure the supply chain over the \\nnext several years. It decides what the chain's configuration will be, how resources will \\nbe allocated, and what processes each stage will perform. Strategic decisions made by \\ncompanies include whether to outsource or perform a supply chain function in-house, \\nthe location and capacities of production and warehousing facilities, the products to be \\nmanufactured or stored at various locations, the modes of transportation to be made \\navailable along different shipping legs, and the type of information system to be uti\\xad\\nlized. A firm must ensure that the supply chain configuration supports its strategic \\nobjectives and increases the supply chain surplus during this phase. Cisco's decisions \\nregarding its choice of supply sources for components, contract manufacturers for \\nmanufacturing, and the location and capacity of its warehouses, are all supply chain \\ndesign or strategic decisions. Supply chain design decisions are typically made for the \\nlong term (a matter of years) and are very expensive to alter on short notice. \\nConsequently, when companies make these decisions, they must take into account \\nuncertainty in anticipated market conditions over the next few years. \\n2. Supply Chain Planning: For decisions made during this phase, the time frame con\\xad\\nsidered is a quarter to a year. Therefore, the supply chain's configuration determined in \\nthe strategic phase is fixed. This configuration establishes constraints within which \\nplanning must be done. The goal of planning is to maximize the supply chain surplus \\nthat can be generated over the planning horizon given the constraints established dur\\xad\\ning the strategic or design phase. Companies start the planning phase with a forecast \\nfor the coming year (or a comparable time frame) of demand in different markets. \\nPlanning includes making decisions regarding which markets will be supplied from \\nwhich locations, the subcontracting of manufacturing, the inventory policies to be fol\\xad\\nlowed, and the timing and size of marketing and price promotions. Dell's decisions=\\xad\\nregarding markets supplied by a production facility and target production quantities at \\neach location are classified as planning decisions. Planning establishes parameters \\nwithin which a supply chain will function over a specified period of time. In the plan\\xad\\nning phase, companies must include uncertainty in demand, exchange rates, and com\\xad\\npetition over this time horizon in their decisions. Given a shorter time frame and better \\nforecasts than the design phase, companies in the planning phase try to incorporate \\nany flexibility built into the supply chain in the design phase and exploit it to optimize \\nperformance. As a result of the planning phase, companies define a set of operating \\npolicies that govern short-term operations. \\n3. Supply Chain Operation: The time horizon here is weekly or daily, and during this \\nphase companies make decisions regarding individual customer orders. At the opera\\xad\\ntional level, supply chain configuration is considered fixed, and planning policies are \\nalready defined. The goal of supply chain operations is to handle incoming customer \\norders in the best possible manner. During this phase, firms allocate inventory or pro\\xad\\nduction to individual orders, set a date that an order is to be filled, generate pick lists at \\na warehouse, allocate an order to a particular shipping mode and shipment, set delivery\"),\n",

Because operational decisions are \\nbeing made in the short term (minutes, hours, or days), there is less uncertainty about \\ndemand information. Given the constraints established by the configuration and plan\\xad\\nning policies, the goal during the operation phase is to exploit the reduction of uncer\\xad\\ntainty and optimize performance. \\nThe design, planning, and operation of a supply chain have a strong impact on \\noverall profitability and success. It is fair to state that a large part of the success of firms \\nlike Wal-Mart and Dell can be attributed to their effective supply chain design, plan\\xad\\nning, and operation. \\nIn later chapters, we develop concepts and present methodologies that can be used \\nat each of the three decision phases described earlier. Most of our discussion addresses \\nthe supply chain design and planning phases. \\nKEYPOINT········SuppiYchain·decision.phase~may be 6ategorized.asdesign, planning, \\nor operational, depending. on the time frarhe during· which the decisions made apply, \\n1.5 PROCESS VIEWS OF A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nA supply chain is a sequence of processes and flows that take place within and between \\ndifferent stages and combine to fill a customer need for a product. There are two dif\\xad\\nferent ways to view the processes performed in a supply chain. \\n1. Cycle View: The processes in a supply chain are divided into a series of cycles, each \\nperformed at the interface between two successive stages of a supply chain. \\n2. Push/Pull View: The processes in a supply chain are divided into two categories \\ndepending on whether they are executed in response to a customer order or in antici\\xad\\npation of customer orders. Pull processes are initiated by a customer order, whereas \\npush processes are initiated and performed in anticipation of customer orders. \\nCYCLE VIEW OF SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES \\nGiven the five stages of a supply chain shown in Figure 1-2, all supply chain processes \\ncan be broken down into the following four process cycles, as shown in Figure 1-3: \\n• Customer order cycle \\n• Replenishment cycle \\n• Manufacturing cycle \\n• Procurement cycle \\nEach cycle occurs at the interface between two successive stages of the supply \\nchain. The five stages thus result in four supply chain process cycles. Not every supply \\nchain will have all four cycles clearly separated. For example, a grocery supply chain in \\nwhich a retailer stocks finished-goods inventories and places replenishment orders \\nwith a distributor is likely to have all four cycles separated. Dell, in contrast, sells· \\ndirectly to customers, thus bypassing the retailer and distributor. \\nEach cycle consists of six subprocesses as shown in Figure 1-4. Each cycle starts \\nwith the supplier marketing the product to customers. A buyer then places an order \\nthat is received by the supplier. The supplier supplies the order, which is received by \\nthe buyer. The buyer may return some of the product or other recycled material to the \\nsupplier or a third party. The cycle of activities then begins all over again.'),\n",

In the customer order cycle, demand is external to the sup\\xad\\nply chain and thus uncertain. In all other cycles, order placement is uncertain but can \\nbe projected based on policies followed by the particular supply chain stage. For exam\\xad\\nple, in the procurement cycle, a tire supplier to an automotive manufacturer can pre\\xad\\ndict tire demand precisely once the production schedule at the manufacturer is known. \\nThe second difference across cycles relates to the scale of an order. Whereas a cus\\xad\\ntomer buys a single car, the dealer orders multiple cars at a time from the manufac\\xad\\nturer, and the manufacturer, in turn, orders an even larger quantity of tires from the \\nsupplier. As we move from the customer to the supplier, the number of individual \\norders declines and the size of each order increases. Thus, sharing of information and \\noperating policies across supply chain stages becomes more important as we move far\\xad\\nther from the end customer. \\nA cycle view of the supply chain is very useful when considering operational decisions \\nbecause it clearly specifies the roles of each member of the supply chain. The detailed \\nprocess description of a supply chain in the cycle view forces a supply chain designer to \\nconsider the infrastructure required to support these processes. The cycle view is useful, \\nfor example, when setting up information systems to support supply chain operations. \\nKEY .. POINT . A cycle view bf the supply ch~in . clearly defines· the 'processes· ihvolved \\nand the owners of each process. This view is very useful when considering operational \\ndecisions because it specifies the roles and responsibilities of each member of the sup\\xad\\nply chain and the desired outcome for each process, \\nPUSH/PULL VIEW OF SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES \\nAll processes in a supply chain fall into one of two categories depending on the timing \\nof their execution relative to end customer demand. With pull processes, execution is \\ninitiated in response to a customer order. With push processes, execution is initiated in \\nanticipation of customer orders. Therefore, at the time of execution of a pull process, \\ncustomer demand is known with certainty, whereas at the time of execution of a push \\nprocess, demand is not known and must be forecast. Pull processes may also be \\nreferred to as reactive processes because they react to customer demand. Push \\nprocesses may also be referred to as speculative processes because they respond to \\nspeculated (or forecasted) rather than actual demand. The push/pull boundary in a \\nsupply chain separates push processes from pull processes as shown in Figure 1-5. Push \\nprocesses operate in an uncertain environment because customer demand is not yet \\nknown. Pull processes operate in an environment in which customer demand is known. \\nThey are, however, often constrained by inventory and capacity decisions that were \\nmade in the push phase. \\nLet us compare a make-to-stock environment like that of L.L.Bean and a build-to\\xad\\norder environment like that of Dell to compare the push/pull view and the cycle view. \\nL.L.Bean executes all processes in the customer order cycle after the customer \\narrives. All processes that are part of the customer order cycle are thus pull processes. \\nOrder fulfillment takes place from product in inventory that is built up in anticipation \\nof customer orders. The goal of the replenishment cycle is to ensure product availabil\\xad\\nity when a customer order arrives. All processes in the replenishment cycle are per\\xad\\nformed in anticipation of demand and are thus push processes. The same holds true for \\nprocesses in the manufacturing and procurement cycle.

There are \\neffectively only two cycles in the Dell supply chain: (1) a customer order and manufac\\xad\\nturing cycle and (2) a procurement cycle, as shown in Figure 1-7. \\nAll processes in the customer order and manufacturing cycle at Dell are thus classi\\xad\\nfied as pull processes because they are initiated by customer arrival. Dell, however, does \\nnot place component orders in response to a customer order. Inventory is replenished in \\nanticipation of customer demand. All processes in the procurement cycle for Dell are \\nthus classified as push processes, because they are in response to a forecast. The processes \\nin the Dell supply chain break up into pull and push processes as shown in Figure 1-7. \\nA push/pull view of the supply chain is very useful when considering strategic deci\\xad\\nsions relating to supply chain design. The goal is to identify an appropriate push/pull \\nboundary such that the supply chain can match supply and demand effectively. \\nThe paint industry provides another excellent example of the gains from suitably \\nadjusting the push/pull boundary. The manufacture of paint requires production of the \\nbase, mixing of suitable colors, and packing. Until the 1980s, all these processes were \\nperformed in large factories and paint cans were shipped to stores. These qualified as \\npush processes, as they were performed to a forecast in anticipation of customer \\ndemand. Given the uncertainty of demand, the paint supply chain had great difficulty \\nmatching supply and demand. In the 1990s, paint supply chains were restructured such \\nthat mixing of colors was done at retail stores after customers placed their orders. In \\nother words, color mixing was shifted from the push to the pull phase of the supply \\nchain even though base preparation and packing of cans was still performed in the \\npush phase. The result is that customers are always able to get the color of their choice, \\nwhile total paint inventories across the supply chain have declined. \\nKEY POINT Apush/pull view of the supply chain categorizesprocesses based on \\nwhether they are initiated in response to a customer order (pull) or in anticipation of a \\ncustomer order (push). This view is very useful when considering strategic deCisions \\nrelating to supply chain design.'),\n",

Internal supply chain management (/SCM): All processes that are internal to the firm \\n3. Supplier Relationship Management (SRM): All processes that focus on the inter\\xad\\nface between the firm and its suppliers \\nThe three macro processes manage the flow of information, product, and funds \\nrequired to generate, receive, and fulfill a customer request. The CRM macro process \\naims to generate customer demand and facilitate the placement and tracking of orders. \\nIt includes processes such as marketing, pricing, sales, order management, and call cen\\xad\\nter management. At an industrial distributor such as W.W. Grainger, CRM processes \\ninclude the preparation of catalogs and other marketing materials, management of the \\nWeb site, and management of the call center that takes orders and provides service. The \\nISCM macro process aims to fulfill demand generated by the CRM process in a timely \\nmanner and at the lowest possible cost. ISCM processes include the planning of internal \\nproduction and storage capacity, preparation of demand and supply plans, and fulfill\\xad\\nment of actual orders. At W.W. Grainger, ISCM processes include planning for the loca\\xad\\ntion and size of warehouses; deciding which products to carry at each warehouse; \\npreparing inventory management policies; and picking, packing, and shipping actual \\norders. The SRM macro process aims to arrange for and manage supply sources for var\\xad\\nious goods and services. SRM processes include the evaluation and selection of suppli\\xad\\ners, negotiation of supply terms, and communication regarding new products and orders \\nwith suppliers. At W.W. Grainger, SRM processes include the selection of suppliers for \\nvarious products, negotiation of pricing and delivery terms with suppliers, sharing of \\ndemand and supply plans with suppliers, and the placement of replenishment orders. \\nAll three supply chain macro processes and their component processes are shown \\nin Figure 1-8. \\nObserve that all three macro processes are aimed at serving the same customer. \\nFor a supply chain to be successful, it is crucial that the three macro processes are well \\nintegrated. The importance of this integration is discussed in Chapters 16 and 17. The \\norganizational structure of the firm has a strong influence on the success or failure of \\nthe integration effort. In many firms, marketing is in charge of the CRM macro process, \\nmanufacturing handles the ISCM macro process, and purchasing oversees the SRM \\nmacro process-with very little communication among them.

In 1996, Gateway was one of the first PC \\nmanufacturers to start selling PCs online. Over the years Gateway expanded its opera\\xad\\ntions worldwide, with sales and manufacturing presence in Europe and Asia Pacific. In \\n1999, the company had three plants in the United States, a plant in Ireland, and one in \\nMalaysia. \\nIn the late 1990s, Gateway introduced an aggressive strategy of opening Gateway \\nretail stores throughout the United States. By January 2002, Gateway had approxi\\xad\\nmately 280 retail stores in the United States. Gateway's strategy was to avoid carrying \\nany finished-goods inventory at the retail stores and simply use these stores for cus\\xad\\ntomers to try the PCs and obtain help in deciding on the right configuration to pur\\xad\\nchase. When customers placed their order, PCs were manufactured to order and \\nshipped from one of the assembly plants. \\nInitially, investors rewarded Gateway for this strategy and raised the stock price to \\nmore than $80 per share in late 1999. However, this success did not last. By November \\n2002, Gateway shares had dropped to less than $4 and Gateway was losing a significant \\namount of money. Plants in Salt Lake City, Ireland, and Malaysia were shut. By April \\n2004, Gateway had closed all its retail outlets and reduced the number of configura\\xad\\ntions offered to customers. The company was looking to sell its PCs through electronics \\nretailers such as Best Buy and Circuit City. As you can imagine, this was quite a transi\\xad\\ntion for the company to experience. \\nThe following questions highlight supply chain decisions that have a bearing on \\nGateway's performance: \\n1. Why did Gateway have multiple production facilities in the United States? \\nIn the last few years Dell has also increased the number of facilities in the \\nUnited States to four. What advantages or disadvantages does increasing \\nthe number of production facilities offer? How does Gateway decide which \\nproduction facility will produce and ship a customer order? \\n2. What factors did Gateway consider when deciding which plants to close?\"),\n",

In 2004, Inditex reported sales of 13 billion euros from more than \\n2,200 retail outlets in 56 countries. The company opened a new store for each day in \\n2004. In an industry in which customer demand is fickle, Zara has grown rapidly with a \\nstrategy to be highly responsive to changing trends with affordable prices. Whereas \\ndesign-to-sales cycle times in the apparel industry have traditionally averaged more \\nthan six months, Zara has achieved cycle times of five to six weeks. This speed allows \\nZara to introduce new designs every week and to change 75 percent of its merchandise \\ndisplay every three to four weeks. Thus, Zara's products on display match customer \\npreferences much more closely than the competition. The result is that Zara sells most \\nof its products at full price and has about half the markdowns in its stores compared to \\nthe competition. \\nZara manufactures its apparel using a combination of flexible and quick sources in \\nEurope (mostly Portugal and Spain) and low-cost sources in Asia. This contrasts with \\nmost apparel manufacturers, who have moved most of their manufacturing to Asia. \\nAbout 40 percent of the manufacturing capacity is owned by Inditex, with the rest out\\xad\\nsourced. Products with highly uncertain demand are sourced out of Europe, whereas \\nproducts that are more predictable are sourced from its Asian locations. More than 40 \\npercent of its finished-goods purchases and most of its in-house production occur after \\nthe sales season starts. This compares with less than 20 percent production after the \\nstart of a sales season for a typical retailer. This responsiveness and the postponement \\nof decisions until after trends are known allow Zara to reduce inventories and forecast \\nerror. Zara has also invested heavily in information technology to ensure that the lat\\xad\\nest sales data are available to drive replenishment and production decisions. \\nUntil 2002, Zara centralized all its European distribution and some of its global \\ndistribution through a single distribution center (DC) in Spain. It also had some \\nsmaller satellite DCs in Latin American countries. Shipments from the DCs to stores \\nwere made twice a week. This allowed store inventory to closely match customer \\ndemand. As Zara has grown, it has built another distribution center in Spain. \\nThe following questions raise supply chain issues that are central to Zara's strategy \\nand success: \\n1. What advantage does Zara gain against the competition by having a very \\nresponsive supply chain? \\n2. Why has Inditex chosen to have both in-house manufacturing and out\\xad\\nsourced manufacturing? Why has Inditex maintained manufacturing capac\\xad\\nity in Europe even though manufacturing in Asia is much cheaper? \\n3. Why does Zara source products with uncertain demand from local manufac\\xad\\nturers and products with predictable demand from Asian manufacturers?\"),\n",

This practice \\ndiffers from that of a traditional bookstore, which usually purchases directly from pub\\xad\\nlishers and stocks books in anticipation of customer orders. Today, Amazon has six \\nwarehouses where it holds inventory. Amazon stocks best-selling books, though it still \\ngets other titles from distributors or publishers. It uses the U.S. Postal Service and other \\npackage carriers such as UPS and FedEx to send books to customers. \\nAmazon has continued to expand the set of products that it sells online. Besides \\nbooks and music, Amazon has added many product categories such as toys, apparel, \\nelectronics, jewelry, and shoes. After several years of losses, Amazon has been prof\\xad\\nitable since 2003. \\nSeveral brick-and-mortar players including traditional booksellers such as Borders \\nand Barnes & Noble have also started selling using the Internet channel. Barnes & \\nNoble has set up Barnes&Noble.com as a separate company, whereas Borders uses \\nAmazon to fulfill its online orders after initially trying to operate an online business. In \\nthe case of Barnes & Noble, the retail store and the online supply chains share ware\\xad\\nhousing and transportation to some extent.

Should traditional booksellers like Barnes and Noble integrate e-commerce \\ninto their current supply chain or manage it as a separate supply chain? \\n6. For what products does thee-commerce channel offer the greatest advantage? \\nWhat characterizes these products? \\n1.7 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Discuss the goal of a supply chain and explain the impact of supply chain decisions on the \\nsuccess of a firm. \\nThe goal of a supply chain should be to maximize overall supply chain profitability. \\nSupply chain profitability is the difference between the revenue generated from the cus\\xad\\ntomer and the total cost incurred across all stages of the supply chain. Supply chain decisions \\nhave a large impact on the success or failure of each firm because they significantly influence \\nboth the revenue generated and the cost incurred. Successful supply chains manage flows of \\nproduct, information, and funds to provide a high level of product availability to the cus\\xad\\ntomer while keeping costs low. \\n2. Identify the three key supply chain decision phases and explain the significance of each one. \\nSupply chain decisions may be characterized as strategic (design), planning, or opera\\xad\\ntional, depending on the time period during which they apply. Strategic decisions relate to \\nsupply chain configuration. These decisions have a long-term impact lasting several years. \\nPlanning decisions cover a period of a few months to a year and include decisions such as pro\\xad\\nduction plans, subcontracting, and promotions over that period. Operational decisions span \\nfrom minutes to days and include sequencing production and filling specific orders. Strategic \\ndecisions define the constraints for planning decisions, and planning decisions define the con\\xad\\nstraints for operational decisions. \\n3. Describe the cycle and push/pull views of a supply chain. \\nA cycle view of a supply chain divides processes into cycles, each performed at the inter\\xad\\nface between two successive stages of a supply chain. Each cycle starts with an order placed \\nby one stage of the supply chain and ends when the order is received from the supplier stage. \\nA push/pull view of a supply chain characterizes processes based on their timing relative to \\nthat of a customer order. Pull processes are performed in response to a customer order, \\nwhereas push processes are performed in anticipation of customer orders. \\n4. Classify the supply chain macro processes in a firm. \\nAll supply chain processes can be classified into three macro processes based on \\nwhether they are at the customer or supplier interface or are internal to the firm. The CRM \\nmacro process consists of all processes at the interface between the firm and the customer \\nthat work to generate, receive, and track customer orders. The ISCM macro process consists \\nof all supply chain processes that are internal to the firm and work to plan for and fulfill cus\\xad\\ntomer orders. The SRM macro process consists of all supply chain processes at the interface \\nbetween the firm and its suppliers that work to evaluate and select suppliers and then source \\ngoods and services from them. \\nDiscussion Questions \\n1. Consider the purchase of a can of soda at a convenience store. Describe the various stages in \\nthe supply chain and the different flows involved. \\n2. Why should a firm like Dell take into account total supply chain profitability when making \\ndecisions? \\n3. What are some strategic, planning, and operational decisions that must be made by an \\napparel retailer like The Gap?'),\n",

Explain why achieving strategic fit is critical to a company's overall success. \\n2. Describe how a company achieves strategic fit between its supply chain strategy and its com\\xad\\npetitive strategy. \\n3. Discuss the importance of expanding the scope of strategic fit across the supply chain. \\nI\\nn Chapter 1, we discuss what a supply chain is and the importance of supply chain \\ndesign, planning, and operation to a firm's success. In this chapter, we define supply \\nchain strategy and explain how creating a strategic fit between a company's competi\\xad\\ntive strategy and its supply chain strategy affects performance. We also discuss the \\nimportance of expanding the scope of strategic fit from one operation within a com\\xad\\npany to all stages of the supply chain. \\n2.1 COMPETITIVE AND SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES \\nA company's competitive strategy defines, relative to its competitors, the set of cus\\xad\\ntomer needs that it seeks to satisfy through its products and services. For example, \\nWal-Mart aims to provide high availability of a variety of products of reasonable qual\\xad\\nity at low prices. Most products sold at Wal-Mart are commonplace (everything from \\nhome appliances to clothing) and can be purchased elsewhere. What Wal-Mart pro\\xad\\nvides is a low price and product availability. McMaster-Carr sells maintenance, repair, \\nand operations (MRO) products. It offers more than 400,000 different products \\nthrough both a catalog and a Web site. Its competitive strategy is built around provid\\xad\\ning the customer with convenience, availability, and responsiveness. With this focus on \\nresponsiveness, McMaster does not compete based on low price. Clearly, the competi\\xad\\ntive strategy at Wal-Mart is different from that at McMaster. \\nWe can also contrast Dell, with its build-to-order model, with a firm like Gateway \\nselling eMachines PCs through retailers. Dell has stressed customization and variety at \\na reasonable cost, with customers having to wait approximately one week to get their \\nproduct. In contrast, a customer can walk into a computer retailer, be helped by a sales\\xad\\nperson, and leave the same day with an eMachines computer. The amount of variety \\nand customization available at the retailer, however, is limited. In each case, the com\\xad\\npetitive strategy is defined based on how the customer prioritizes product cost, deliv\\xad\\nery time, variety, and quality. A McMaster-Carr customer places greater emphasis on \\nproduct variety and response time than on cost. A Wal-Mart customer, in contrast,\"),\n",

A Dell customer, purchasing online, places great \\nemphasis on product variety and customization. A customer purchasing an eMachines \\nPC at a retailer is most concerned with price, fast response time, and help in product \\nselection. Thus, a firm's competitive strategy will be defined based on its customers' \\npriorities. Competitive strategy targets one or more customer segments and aims to \\nprovide products and services that satisfy these customers' needs. \\nTo see the relationship between competitive and supply chain strategies, we start \\nwith the value chain for a typical organization, as shown in Figure 2-1. \\nThe value chain begins with new product development, which creates specifications \\nfor the product. Marketing and sales generate demand by publicizing the customer pri\\xad\\norities that the products and services will satisfy. Marketing also brings customer input \\nback to new product development. Using new product specifications, operations trans\\xad\\nforms inputs to outputs to create the product. Distribution either takes the product to \\nthe customer or brings the customer to the product. Service responds to customer \\nrequests during or after the sale. These are core processes or functions that must be \\nperformed for a successful sale. Finance, accounting, information technology, and \\nhuman resources support and facilitate the functioning of the value chain. \\nTo execute a company's competitive strategy, all these functions play a role, and \\neach must develop its own strategy. Here, strategy refers to what each process or func\\xad\\ntion will try to do particularly well. \\nA product development strategy specifies the portfolio of new products that a com\\xad\\npany will try to develop. It also dictates whether the development effort will be made \\ninternally or outsourced. A marketing and sales strategy specifies how the market will \\nbe segmented and how the product will be positioned, priced, and promoted. A supply \\nchain strategy determines the nature of procurement of raw materials, transportation \\nof materials to and from the company, manufacture of the product or operation to provide \\nthe service, and distribution of the product to the customer, along with any follow-up \\nservice and a specification of whether these processes will be performed in-house or \\noutsourced. Given that firms are rarely completely vertically integrated, it is important \\nto recognize that the supply chain strategy defines not only what processes within the \\nfirm should do well but also what the role played by each supply chain entity is. For \\nexample, Cisco's supply chain strategy calls for most component manufacturing and \\nassembly to be outsourced. In this case, Cisco's supply chain strategy identifies not just \\nwhat Cisco should do well but also the role of each third party to which supply chain \\ntasks are outsourced. Supply chain strategy specifies what the operations, distribution, \\nand service functions, whether performed in-house or outsourced, should do particu\\xad\\nlarly well. Because our focus here is on supply chain strategy, we define it in more \\ndetail. Supply chain strategy includes a specification of the broad structure of the\"),\n",

Supply chain strategy also includes design decisions regarding inven\\xad\\ntory, transportation, operating facilities, and information flows. For example, Amazon\\'s \\ndecisions to build warehouses to stock some products and to continue using distribu\\xad\\ntors as a source of other products are part of its supply chain strategy. Similarly, \\nToyota\\'s decision to have production facilities in each of its major markets is part of its \\nsupply chain strategy. \\nThe value chain emphasizes the close relationship between the functional strate\\xad\\ngies within a company. Each function is crucial if a company is to satisfy customer \\nneeds profitably. Thus, the various functional strategies cannot be formulated in isola\\xad\\ntion. They are closely intertwined and must fit and support each other if a company is \\nto succeed. \\nFor example, Seven-Eleven Japan\\'s success can be related to the excellent fit \\namong its functional strategies. Marketing at Seven-Eleven has emphasized conve\\xad\\nnience in the form of easy access to stores and availability of a wide range of products \\nand services. New product development at Seven-Eleven is constantly adding products \\nand services, such as bill payment services that draw customers in and exploit the excel\\xad\\nlent information infrastructure and the fact that customers frequently visit Seven\\xad\\nEleven. Operations and distribution at Seven-Eleven have focused on having a high \\ndensity of stores, being very responsive, and providing an excellent information infra\\xad\\nstructure. The result is a virtuous cycle in which supply chain infrastructure is exploited \\nto offer new products and service that increase demand, and the increased demand in \\nturn makes it easier for operations to improve the density of stores, responsiveness in \\nreplenishment, and the information infrastructure. \\nIn the next section we elaborate on this notion of fit and seek to answer this ques\\xad\\ntion: Given its competitive strategy, what should a company\\'s supply chain try to do \\nparticularly well? \\n2.2 ACHIEVING STRATEGIC FIT \\nThis chapter is built on the idea that for any company to be successful, its supply chain \\nstrategy and competitive strategy must fit together. Strategic fit means that both the \\ncompetitive and supply chain strategies have aligned goals. It refers to consistency \\nbetween the customer priorities that the competitive strategy hopes to satisfy and the \\nsupply chain capabilities that the supply chain strategy aims to build. The issue of \\nachieving strategic fit is a key consideration during the supply chain strategy or design \\nphase discussed in Chapter 1. \\nAll processes and functions that are part of a company\\'s value chain contribute tq \\nits success or failure. These processes and functions do not operate in isolation; no one \\nprocess or function can ensure the chain\\'s success. Failure at any one process or func\\xad\\ntion, however, may lead to failure of the overall chain. A company\\'s success or failure \\nis thus closely linked to the following keys: \\n1. The competitive strategy and all functional strategies must fit together to form a \\ncoordinated overall strategy. Each functional strategy must support other func\\xad\\ntional strategies and help a firm reach its competitive strategy goal.'),\n",

The different functions in a company must appropriately structure their processes \\nand resources to be able to execute these strategies successfully. \\n3. The design of the overall supply chain and the role of each stage must be aligned to \\nsupport the supply chain strategy. \\nA company may fail either because of a lack of strategic fit or because its overall \\nsupply chain design, processes, and resources do not provide the capabilities to support \\nthe desired strategic fit. In thinking of the major tasks of a chief executive officer \\n(CEO), there are few greater than the job of aligning the supply chain design and all of \\nthe core functional strategies with the overall competitive strategy to achieve strategic \\nfit. If this alignment is not achieved, conflicts arise between different functional goals \\nwithin the firm, or between the goals of different supply chain stages. Such conflicts \\nresult in different functions within the firm and stages across the supply chain targeting \\ndifferent customer priorities. This conflict within the firm or across the supply chain \\nleads to conflicts during supply chain operation. \\nConsider, for example, a situation in which marketing is publicizing a company's \\nability to provide a large variety of products very quickly; simultaneously, distribution \\nis targeting the lowest cost means of transportation. In this situation, it is very likely \\nthat distribution will delay orders so it can get better transportation economies by \\ngrouping orders together or using inexpensive but slow modes of transportation. This \\naction conflicts with marketing's stated goal of providing variety quickly. Similarly, \\nconsider a scenario where a retailer has decided to provide a high level of variety while \\ncarrying low levels of inventory but has selected suppliers and carriers based on their \\nlow price and not their responsiveness. In this case, the retailer is likely to end up with \\nunhappy customers because of poor product availability. \\nTo elaborate on strategic fit, let us return to the example of Dell Computer from \\nChapter 1. Dell's competitive strategy is to provide a large variety of customizable \\nproducts at a reasonable price. Its customers can select from among thousands of pos\\xad\\nsible PC configurations. In terms of supply chain strategy, a PC manufacturer has a \\nrange of options. At one extreme, a company can have an efficient supply chain with a \\nfocus on the ability to produce low-cost PCs by limiting variety and exploiting \\neconomies of scale. At the other extreme, a company can have a highly flexible and \\nresponsive supply chain that is very good at producing a large variety of products. In \\nthis second case, costs will be higher than in an efficient supply chain. Both supply \\nchain strategies are viable by themselves, but do not necessarily fit with Dell's compet\\xad\\nitive strategy. A supply chain strategy that emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness \\nhas a better strategic fit with Dell's competitive strategy of providing a large variety of \\ncustomizable products. \\nThis notion of fit also extends to Dell's other functional strategies. For instance, its \\nnew product development strategy should emphasize designing products that are eas\\xad\\nily customizable, which may include designing common platforms across several prod\\xad\\nucts and the use of common components. Dell products use common components and \\nare designed to be assembled quickly. This feature allows Dell to assemble customized \\nPCs quickly in response to a customer order. The design of new products at Dell sup\\xad\\nports the supply chain's ability to assemble customized PCs in response to customer \\norders. This capability, in turn, supports Dell's strategic goal of offering customization \\nto its customers. Dell has clearly achieved strong strategic fit among its different func\\xad\\ntional strategies and its competitive strategy. The notion of fit also extends to other \\nstages in the Dell supply chain. Given that Dell provides a high degree of customiza\\xad\\ntion while operating with low levels of inventory, it is crucial that its suppliers and car\\xad\\nriers be responsive. For example, the ability of carriers to merge a PC from Dell with a\"),\n",

Dell has \\ntried to achieve this alignment of capabilities across the supply chain. \\nHOW IS STRATEGIC FIT ACHIEVED? \\nWhat does a company need to do to achieve that all-important strategic fit between the \\nsupply chain and competitive strategies? A competitive strategy will specify, either \\nexplicitly or implicitly, one or more customer segments that a company hopes to satisfy. \\nTo achieve strategic fit, a company must ensure that its supply chain capabilities sup\\xad\\nport its ability to satisfy the targeted customer segments. \\nThere are three basic steps to achieving this strategic fit, which we outline here and \\nthen discuss in more detail: \\n1. Understanding the Customer and Supply Chain Uncertainty: First, a company \\nmust understand the customer needs for each targeted segment and the uncertainty \\nthe supply chain faces in satisfying these needs. These needs help the company define \\nthe desired cost and service requirements. The supply chain uncertainty helps the com\\xad\\npany identify the extent of the unpredictability of demand, disruption, and delay that \\nthe supply chain must be prepared for. \\n2. Understanding the Supply Chain Capabilities: There are many types of supply \\nchains, each of which is designed to perform different tasks well. A company must \\nunderstand what its supply chain is designed to do well. \\n3. Achieving Strategic Fit: If a mismatch exists between what the supply chain does par\\xad\\nticularly well and the desired customer needs, the company will either need to restructure \\nthe supply chain to support the competitive strategy or alter its competitive strategy. \\nStep 1 : Understanding the Customer and Supply Chain Uncertainty \\nTo understand the customer, a company must identify the needs of the customer seg\\xad\\nment being served. Let us compare Seven-Eleven Japan and a discounter such as Sam's \\nClub (a part ofWal-Mart). When customers go to Seven-Eleven to purchase detergent, \\nthey go there for the convenience of a nearby store and are not necessarily looking for \\nthe lowest price. In contrast, low price is very important to a Sam's Club customer. This \\ncustomer may be willing to tolerate less variety and even purchase very large package \\nsizes as long as the price is low. Even though customers purchase detergent at both \\nplaces, the demand varies along certain attributes. In the case of Seven-Eleven, cus\\xad\\ntomers are in a hurry and want convenience. In the case of Sam's Club, they want a low \\nprice and are willing to spend time getting it. In general, customer demand from differ\\xad\\nent segments varies along several attributes as follows. \\n• The Quantity of the Product Needed in Each Lot: An emergency order for mate\\xad\\nrial needed to repair a production line is likely to be small. An order for material \\nto construct a new production line is likely to be large. \\n• The Response Time that Customers are Willing to Tolerate: The tolerable response \\ntime for the emergency order is likely to be short, whereas the allowable response \\ntime for the construction order is apt to be long. \\n• The Variety of Products Needed: A customer may place a high premium on the \\navailability of all parts of an emergency repair order from a single supplier. This \\nmay not be the case for the construction order. \\n• The Service Level Required: A customer placing an emergency order expects a \\nhigh level of product availability. This customer may go elsewhere if all parts of \\nthe order are not immediately available. This is not apt to happen in the case of \\nthe construction order, for which a long lead time is likely.\"),\n",

This \\nsingle measure then helps define what the supply chain should do particularly well. \\nImplied Demand Uncertainty. At first glance, it may appear that each of the cus\\xad\\ntomer need categories should be viewed differently, but in a very fundamental sense, \\neach customer need can be translated into the metric of implied demand uncertainty. \\nImplied demand uncertainty is demand uncertainty due to the portion of demand that \\nthe supply chain is targeting, not the entire demand. \\nWe make a distinction between demand uncertainty and implied demand uncer\\xad\\ntainty. Demand uncertainty reflects the uncertainty of customer demand for a product. \\nImplied demand uncertainty, in contrast, is the resulting uncertainty for only the por\\xad\\ntion of the demand that the supply chain plans to satisfy and the attributes the cus\\xad\\ntomer desires. For example, a firm supplying only emergency orders for a product will \\nface a higher implied demand uncertainty than a firm that supplies the same product \\nwith a long lead time, as the second firm has an opportunity to fulfill the orders evenly \\nover the long lead time. \\nAnother illustration of the need for this distinction is the impact of service level. \\nAs a supply chain raises its level of service, it must be able to meet a higher and higher \\npercentage of actual demand, forcing it to prepare for rare surges in demand. Thus, \\nraising the service level increases the implied demand uncertainty even though the \\nproduct's underlying demand uncertainty does not change. \\nBoth the product demand uncertainty and various customer needs that the supply \\nchain tries to fill affect implied demand uncertainty. Table 2-1 illustrates how various \\ncustomer needs affect implied demand uncertainty. \\nAs each individual customer need contributes to the implied demand uncertainty, \\nwe can use implied demand uncertainty as a common metric with which to distinguish \\ndifferent types of demand. \\nCustomer Need \\nRange of quantity required increases \\nLead time decreases \\nVariety of products required increases \\nNumber of channels through which \\nproduct may be acquired increases \\nRate of innovation increases \\nRequired service level increases \\nCauses Implied Demand Uncertainty to ... \\nIncrease because a wider range of the quantity \\nrequired implies greater variance in demand \\nIncrease because there is less time in which to \\nreact to orders \\nIncrease because demand per product becomes \\nmore disaggregate \\nIncrease because the total customer demand is \\nnow disaggregated over more channels \\nIncrease because new products tend to have more \\nuncertain demand \\nIncrease because the firm now has to handle \\nunusual surges in demand\"),\n",

Fisher, Harvard \\nBusiness Review (March-April1997), 83-93. \\nFisher (1997) pointed out that implied demand uncertainty is often correlated with \\nother characteristics of demand, as shown in Table 2-2. An explanation follows. \\n1. Products with uncertain demand are often less mature and have less direct compe\\xad\\ntition. As a result, margins tend to be high. \\n2. Forecasting is more accurate when demand has less uncertainty. \\n3. Increased implied demand uncertainty leads to increased difficulty in matching \\nsupply with demand. For a given product, this dynamic can lead to either a stock\\xad\\nout or an oversupply situation. Increased implied demand uncertainty thus leads \\nto both higher oversupply and a higher stockout rate. \\n4. Markdowns are high for products with high implied demand uncertainty because \\noversupply often results. \\nFirst let us take an example of a product with low implied demand uncertainty\\xad\\nsuch as table salt. Salt has a very low margin, accurate demand forecasts, low stockout \\nrates, and virtually no markdowns. These characteristics match well with Fisher\\'s chart \\nof characteristics for products with highly certain demand. \\nOn the other end of the spectrum, a new palmtop computer has high implied \\ndemand uncertainty. It will likely have a high margin, very inaccurate demand \\nforecasts, high stockout rates (if it is successful), and large markdowns (if it is a failure). \\nThis too matches well with Table 2-2. \\nAnother example is a circuit board supplier whose customers include two different \\ntypes of PC manufacturers. One of its customers is a build-to-order PC manufacturer \\nsuch as Dell that requires same-day lead times. In this case, the supplier might need to \\nbuild up inventory or have very flexible manufacturing to be prepared for whatever \\ndemand Dell has that day. Forecast error and supplier inventories would be high; because \\nof these factors, margins would likely be higher. The supplier\\'s other customer builds a \\nsmall variety of PCs and specifies in advance the number and type of PCs to be built. This \\ninformation gives the supplier a longer lead time and reduces the forecasting errors and \\ninventories. Thus, the supplier would likely get smaller margins from the latter PC manu\\xad\\nfacturer. These examples demonstrate that even with the same product, different cus\\xad\\ntomer segments can have different implied demand uncertainty given disparate service \\nrequirements. \\nLee (2002) pointed out that, along with demand uncertainty, it is important to \\nconsider uncertainty resulting from the capability of the supply chain. For example, \\nwhen a new component is introduced in the PC industry, the quality yields of the pro\\xad\\nduction process tend to be low and breakdowns are frequent.

Creating strategic fit \\nis all about creating a supply chain strategy that best meets the demand a company has \\ntargeted given the uncertainty it faces. \\nWe now consider the characteristics of supply chains and categorize them. Similar \\nto the way we placed demand on a one-dimensional spectrum (the implied uncertainty \\nspectrum), we will also place each supply chain on a spectrum. Like customer needs, \\nsupply chains have many different characteristics that influence their responsiveness \\nand efficiency. \\nFirst we provide some definitions. Supply chain responsiveness includes a supply \\nchain's ability to do the following: \\n• Respond to wide ranges of quantities demanded \\n• Meet short lead times \\n• Handle a large variety of products \\n• Build highly innovative products \\n• Meet a high service level \\n• Handle supply uncertainty \\nThese abilities are similar to many of the characteristics of demand and supply that \\nled to high implied uncertainty. The more of these abilities a supply chain has, the more \\nresponsive it is. \\nResponsiveness, however, comes at a cost. For instance, to respond to a wider range of \\nquantities demanded, capacity must be increased, which increases costs. This increase in \\ncost leads to the second definition: Supply chain efficiency is the inverse of the cost of mak\\xad\\ning and delivering a product to the customer. Increases in cost lower efficiency. For every \\nstrategic choice to increase responsiveness, there are additional costs that lower efficiency. \\nThe cost-responsiveness efficient frontier is the curve in Figure 2-3 showing the lowest \\npossible cost for a given level of responsiveness.

In contrast, a firm on the efficient \\nfrontier can improve its responsiveness only by increasing cost and becoming less \\nefficient. Such a firm must then make a trade-off between efficiency and responsive\\xad\\nness. Of course, firms on the efficient frontier are also continuously improving their \\nprocesses and changing technology to shift the efficient frontier itself. Given the trade\\xad\\noff between cost and responsiveness, a key strategic choice for any supply chain is the \\nlevel of responsiveness it seeks to provide. \\nSupply chains range from those that focus solely on being responsive to those that \\nfocus on a goal of producing and supplying at the lowest possible cost. Figure 2-4 shows \\nthe responsiveness spectrum and where some supply chains fall on this spectrum. \\nThe more capabilities constituting responsiveness a supply chain has, the more \\nresponsive it is. Seven-Eleven Japan replenishes its stores with breakfast items in the \\nmorning, lunch items in the afternoon, and dinner items at night. As a result, the avail\\xad\\nable product variety changes by time of day. Seven-Eleven responds very quickly to \\norders, with store managers placing replenishment orders less than 12 hours before \\nthey are supplied. This practice makes the Seven-Eleven supply chain very responsive. \\nThe Dell supply chain allows a customer to customize any of several thousand PC con\\xad\\nfigurations. Dell then delivers the appropriate PC to the customer within days. The Dell \\nsupply chain is also considered very responsive. Another example of a responsive supply \\nchain is W.W. Grainger. The company faces both demand and supply uncertainty; there\\xad\\nfore, the supply chain has been designed to deal effectively with both. An efficient supply \\nchain, in contrast, lowers cost by eliminating some of its responsive capabilities. For \\nexample, Sam's Club sells a limited variety of products in large package sizes. The supply \\nchain is capable of low costs, and the focus of this supply chain is clearly on efficiency. \\nKEY POINT The second step in achieving strategic fit between competitive and sup\\xad\\nply chain strategies is to understand the supply chain and map it on the responsiveness \\nspectrum. \\nStep 3: Achieving Strategic Fit \\nAfter mapping the level of implied uncertainty and understanding the supply chain \\nposition on the responsiveness spectrum, the third and final step is to ensure that the \\ndegree of supply chain responsiveness is consistent with the implied uncertainty. The \\ngoal is to target high responsiveness for a supply chain facing high implied uncertainty, \\nand efficiency for a supply chain facing low implied uncertainty.\"),\n",

Given the vast variety of PCs, the high level of \\ninnovation, and rapid delivery, demand from Dell customers can be characterized as \\nhaving high demand uncertainty. Some supply uncertainty also exists, especially for \\nnewly introduced components. Dell has the option of designing an efficient or respon\\xad\\nsive supply chain. An efficient supply chain may use slow, inexpensive modes of trans\\xad\\nportation and economies of scale in production. If Dell made these choices, it would \\nhave difficulty supporting the customer\\'s desire for rapid delivery and a wide variety of \\ncustomizable products. Building a responsive supply chain, however, will allow Dell to \\nmeet its customers\\' needs. Therefore, a responsive supply chain strategy is best suited \\nto meet the needs of Dell\\'s targeted customers. \\nNow, consider a pasta manufacturer such as Barilla. Pasta is a product with relatively \\nstable customer demand, giving it a low implied demand uncertainty. Supply is also quite \\npredictable. Barilla could design a highly responsive supply chain in which pasta is custom\\xad\\nmade in very small batches in response to customer orders and shipped via a rapid trans\\xad\\nportation mode such as FedEx. This choice would obviously make the pasta prohibitively \\nexpensive, resulting in a loss of customers. Barilla, therefore, is in a much better position \\nif it designs a more efficient supply chain with a focus on cost reduction. \\nFrom the preceding discussion, it follows that increasing implied uncertainty from \\ncustomers and supply sources is best served by increasing responsiveness from the sup\\xad\\nply chain. This relationship is represented by the \"zone of strategic fit\" illustrated in \\nFigure 2-5. For a high level of performance, companies should move their competitive \\nstrategy (and resulting implied uncertainty) and supply chain strategy (and resulting \\nresponsiveness) toward the zone of strategic fit. \\nThe first step in achieving strategic fit is to assign roles to different stages of the \\nsupply chain that ensure the appropriate level of responsiveness. It is important to \\nunderstand that the desired level of responsiveness required across the supply chain \\nmay be attained by assigning different levels of responsiveness and efficiency to each \\nstage of the supply chain as illustrated by the following examples. \\nIKEA is a Swedish furniture retailer with large stores in more than 20 countries. \\nIKEA has targeted customers who want stylish furniture at a reasonable cost. The com\\xad\\npany limits the variety of styles that it sells. The large scale of each store and the limited \\nvariety of furniture decrease the implied uncertainty faced by the supply chain. IKEA \\nstocks all styles in inventory and serves customers from stock. Thus, it uses inventory to \\nabsorb all the uncertainty faced by the supply chain.

As a result, IKEA passes along very little uncertainty to its manufacturers, who \\ntend to be located in low-cost countries and focus on efficiency. IKEA provides respon\\xad\\nsiveness in the supply chain, with the stores absorbing most of the uncertainty and being \\nresponsive, and the suppliers absorbing very little uncertainty and being efficient. \\nIn contrast, another approach for responsiveness may involve the retailer holding \\nvery little inventory. In this case, the retailer does not contribute significantly to supply \\nchain responsiveness and most of the implied demand uncertainty is passed on to the \\nmanufacturer. For the supply chain to be responsive, the manufacturer now needs to be \\nflexible and have low response times. An example of this approach is England, Inc., a \\nfurniture manufacturer located in Tennessee. Every week, the company makes several \\nthousand sofas and chairs to order, delivering them to furniture stores across the coun\\xad\\ntry within three weeks. England's retailers allow customers to select from a very wide \\nvariety of styles and promise relatively quick delivery. This imposes a high level of \\nimplied uncertainty on the supply chain. The retailers, however, do not carry much \\ninventory and pass most of the implied uncertainty on to England, Inc. The retailers \\ncan thus be efficient because most of the implied uncertainty for the supply chain is \\nabsorbed by England, Inc. with its flexible manufacturing process. England, Inc. itself \\nhas a choice of how much uncertainty it passes along to its suppliers. By holding more \\nraw material inventories, the company allows its suppliers to focus on efficiency. If it \\ndecreases its raw material inventories, its suppliers must become more responsive. \\nThe preceding discussion illustrates that the supply chain can achieve a given level \\nof responsiveness by adjusting the roles of each stage of the supply chain. Making one \\nstage more responsive allows other stages to focus on becoming more efficient. The \\nbest combination of roles depends on the efficiency and flexibility available at each \\nstage. The notion of achieving a given level of responsiveness by assigning different \\nroles and level of uncertainty to different stages of the supply chain is illustrated in \\nFigure 2-6.

There is no supply chain strategy that is always right. \\n2. There is a right supply chain strategy for a given competitive strategy. \\nThe drive for strategic fit should come from the highest levels of the organization. In \\nmany companies, different groups devise competitive and functional strategies. Without \\nproper communication between the groups and coordination by high-level management \\nsuch as the CEO, these strategies are not likely to achieve strategic fit.

We now consider \\nhow multiple products, multiple customer segments, and product life cycle affect \\nstrategic fit. \\nMultiple Products and Customer Segments \\nMost companies produce and sell multiple products to multiple customer segments, \\neach with different characteristics. A department store may sell seasonal products with \\nhigh implied demand uncertainty, such as ski jackets, along with products with low \\nimplied demand uncertainty, such as black socks. The demand in each case maps to a \\ndifferent part of the uncertainty spectrum. W.W. Grainger sells MRO products to both \\nlarge firms, such as Ford and Boeing, and small manufacturers and contractors. The \\ncustomer needs in the two cases are very different. A large firm is much more likely to \\nbe concerned with price, given the large volumes they generate from W.W. Grainger, \\nwhereas a smaller company is apt to go to W.W. Grainger because it is responsive. The \\ntwo segments that are served map to different positions along the implied uncer\\xad\\ntainty spectrum. Another example is Levi Strauss, which sells both customized and'),\n",

Demand for standard-sized jeans has a much lower demand \\nuncertainty than demand for customized jeans. \\nIn each of the aforementioned examples, the products sold and the customer seg\\xad\\nments served have different implied demand uncertainty. When devising supply chain \\nstrategy in these cases, the key issue for a company is to design a supply chain that bal\\xad\\nances efficiency and responsiveness given its portfolio of products, customer segments, \\nand supply sources. \\nThere are several possible routes a company can take to achieve this balance. One \\nis to set up independent supply chains for each different product or customer segment. \\nThis strategy is feasible if each segment is large enough to support a dedicated supply \\nchain. It fails, however, to take advantage of any economies of scope that often exist \\namong a company's different products. Therefore, a preferable strategy is to tailor the \\nsupply chain to best meet the needs of each product's demand. \\nTailoring the supply chain requires sharing some links in the supply chain with some \\nproducts, while having separate operations for other links. The links are shared to achieve \\nmaximum possible efficiency while providing the appropriate level of responsiveness to \\neach segment. For instance, all products may be made on the same line in a plant, but \\nproducts requiring a high level of responsiveness may be shipped using a fast mode of \\ntransportation such as FedEx. Those products that do not have high responsiveness needs \\nmay be shipped by slower and less expensive means such as truck, rail, or even ship. In \\nother instances, products requiring high responsiveness may be manufactured using a very \\nflexible process, whereas products requiring less responsiveness may be manufactured \\nusing a less responsive but more efficient process. The mode of transportation used in \\nboth cases, however, may be the same. In other cases, some products may be held at \\nregional warehouses close to the customer whereas others may be held in a centralized \\nwarehouse far from the customer. W.W. Grainger holds fast-moving items in its decentra\\xad\\nlized locations close to the customer. It holds slow-moving items with higher implied \\ndemand uncertainty in a centralized warehouse. Appropriate tailoring of the supply chain \\nhelps a firm achieve varying levels of responsiveness for a low overall cost. The level of \\nresponsiveness is tailored to each product or customer segment. Tailoring of the supply \\nchain is an important concept that we develop further in subsequent chapters. \\nProduct Life Cycle \\nAs products go through their life cycle, the demand characteristics and the needs of the \\ncustomer segments being served change. Supply characteristics also change as the \\nproduct and production technologies mature. High-tech products are particularly \\nprone to these life-cycle swings over a very short time span. A product goes through its \\nlife cycle from the introductory phase, when only the leading edge of customers is \\ninterested and supply is uncertain, all the way to the point at which the product \\nbecomes a commodity, the market is saturated, and supply is predictable. Thus, if a \\ncompany is to maintain strategic fit, its supply chain strategy must evolve as its prod\\xad\\nucts enter different phases. \\nLet us consider changes in demand and supply characteristics over the life cycle of \\na product. Toward the beginning stages of a product's life cycle: \\n1. Demand is very uncertain and supply may be unpredictable. \\n2. Margins are often high, and time is crucial to gaining sales. \\n3. Product availability is crucial to capturing the market. \\n4. Cost is often a secondary consideration. \\nConsider a pharmaceutical firm introducing a new drug.

The introductory phase of a product's life cycle corre\\xad\\nsponds to high implied uncertainty given the high demand uncertainty and the need \\nfor a high level of product availability. In such a situation, responsiveness is the most \\nimportant characteristic of the supply chain. \\nAs the product becomes a commodity product later in its life cycle, the demand \\nand supply characteristics change. At this stage it is typically the case that: \\n1. Demand has become more certain and supply is predictable. \\n2. Margins are lower due to an increase in competitive pressure. \\n3. Price becomes a significant factor in customer choice. \\nIn the case of a pharmaceutical company, these changes occur when a drug's \\npatent expires and generic drugs are introduced. At this stage, demand for the drug sta\\xad\\nbilizes and margins shrink. Customers make their selections from the various choices \\nbased on price. Production technologies are well developed and supply is predictable. \\nThis stage corresponds to a low level of implied uncertainty. As a result, the supply \\nchain needs to change. In such a situation, efficiency is the most important characteris\\xad\\ntic of the supply chain. \\nThis discussion illustrates that as products mature, the corresponding supply chain \\nstrategy should, in general, move from being responsive to being efficient, as illustrated \\nin Figure 2-8. \\nTo illustrate these ideas, consider the example of Intel Corporation. Each time \\nIntel introduces a new computer processor, there is great uncertainty with respect to \\ndemand for this new product, as it depends on the sales of new high-end PCs. Typically \\nthere is high uncertainty regarding how the market will receive these PCs and what the \\ndemand will be. Supply is unpredictable because yield is low and variable. At this stage, \\nthe Intel supply chain must be very responsive so it can react if demand is very high. \\nAs the Intel processor becomes more mainstream, demand begins to stabilize, and \\nyield from the production process is higher and more predictable. At this point \\ndemand and supply normally display lower implied uncertainty and price becomes a \\ngreater determinant of sales. Now it is important for Intel to have an efficient supply \\nchain in place for producing processors. \\nAll PC manufacturers are subject to the cycle described earlier.

As the model matures, \\ndemand stabilizes and margins shrink. At this stage it is important that the manufac\\xad\\nturer have an efficient supply chain. Apple Computer is an example of a firm that has \\nhad difficulty during product introduction. When it introduced the G4 in 1999, demand \\nfor the machine far exceeded the available supply of processors, resulting in significant \\nlost sales. The supply chain in this case did not display sufficient responsiveness during \\nthe product's introductory phase. \\nThe key point here is that demand and supply characteristics change over a prod\\xad\\nuct's life cycle. Because demand and supply characteristics change, the supply chain \\nstrategy must also change over the product life cycle if a company is to continue \\nachieving strategic fit. \\nGlobalization and Competitive Changes over Time \\nA final dimension to consider when matching supply chain and competitive strategy is \\nthe change in competitor behavior resulting from changes in the marketplace or \\nincreased globalization. Like product life cycles, competitors can change the landscape, \\nthereby requiring a change in the firm's competitive strategy. An example is the growth \\nof mass customization in various industries since the last decade of the twentieth cen\\xad\\ntury. As competitors flood the marketplace with product variety, customers are becom\\xad\\ning accustomed to having their individual needs satisfied. Thus, the competitive focus \\ntoday is on producing sufficient variety at a reasonable price. As more firms increase \\nthe level of variety offered, supply chains have been forced to develop the ability to \\nsupport a wider range of products. Another big change is the increase in global sourc\\xad\\ning of products. The availability of a Chinese-made leather recliner at Wal-Mart for \\n$199 has put pressure on U.S. manufacturers to become much more responsive than \\nthey were in the past. Successful furniture manufacturers in the United States have \\nresponded by offering enough variety to make choice an advantage, while bringing \\ndown response time and keeping prices in check. Similar pressures of globalization are \\nbeing felt in the apparel sector with the end of quotas, and local firms in developed \\ncountries are forced to respond. As the competitive landscape changes, a firm is forced \\nto alter its competitive strategy. With the change in competitive strategy, a firm must \\nalso change its supply chain strategy to maintain strategic fit. \\nKEY POINT. To achieve strategic fit, a firm must tailor its supply chain.to bestmeet \\nthe needs of different custorner segments. To retain strategic. fit, supply.chain strategy \\nmust be adjusted over the life cycle ofa product and as the competitive landscape \\nchanges. \\nIn the next section, we describe how the scope of the supply chain has expanded \\nwhen achieving strategic fit. We also discuss why expanding the scope of strategic fit is \\ncritical to supply chain success. \\n2.3 EXPANDING STRATEGIC SCOPE \\nA key issue relating to strategic fit is the scope, in terms of supply chain stages, across \\nwhich the strategic fit applies. Scope of strategic fit refers to the functions within the \\nfirm and stages across the supply chain that devise an integrated strategy with a shared \\nobjective.

At the opposite extreme, all functional areas across \\nall stages of the supply chain devise strategy jointly with a common objective of maxi\\xad\\nmizing supply chain profit. In this case the scope of strategic fit extends to the entire \\nsupply chain. \\nIn this section we discuss how expanding the scope of strategic fit improves supply \\nchain performance. We represent the scope of strategic fit on a two-dimensional grid. \\nHorizontally, the scope of strategic fit is considered across different supply chain stages, \\nstarting from suppliers and moving all the way along the chain to the customer. \\nVertically, the scope is applied to the fit achieved across different functional strategies\\xad\\ncompetitive, product development, supply chain, and marketing. \\nINTRACOMPANY INTRAOPERATION SCOPE: THE MINIMIZE \\nLOCAL COST VIEW \\nThe most limited scope over which strategic fit is considered is one operation within a \\nfunctional area within a company. This is referred to as intracompany intraoperation \\nscope. Here, each operation within each stage of the supply chain devises strategy inde\\xad\\npendently. In such a setting, the resulting collection of strategies will most likely not \\ncome close to maximizing supply chain profit, because different functions and opera\\xad\\ntions have conflicting local objectives. This limited scope was the dominant practice \\nduring the 1950s and 1960s, when each operation within each stage of the supply chain \\nattempted to minimize its own costs. Consider an example of a distribution company in \\nwhich a transportation operation is evaluated based on average shipping cost per unit. \\nShipping the product individually costs $5/item, whereas shipping by truckload costs \\nonly $1/item. To minimize cost, the transportation group ships the product in full truck\\xad\\nloads because this practice results in the lowest shipping cost per unit. This decision, \\nwhile minimizing transportation cost per unit, increases response time and may under\\xad\\nmine a competitive strategy based on responsiveness. The key point here is that the \\ntransportation decision was made independent of other functions within the firm \\nand the rest of the supply chain. In this case, the scope of strategic fit is restricted to \\na portion (transportation) of the distributor stage within the supply chain. The \\nsmallest ellipse in Figure 2-9 represents the scope of strategic fit at the distributor in \\nthis instance. \\nCompetitive \\nStrategy \\nProduct \\nDevelopment \\nStrategy \\nSupply Chain \\nStrategy \\nMarketing \\nStrategy \\nSuppliers Manufacturer Distributor Retailer Customer \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I I I \\n-;~J;;~~~~~~;-i -----------~--lniracaniv~lir ____ _ \\nInt~rfunctional Intrafunctirnal \\n: at DistribUtor \\n------------~------------ ------------T------------1 I \\nlnttacompany i \\nInt~rfunctional 1 Intracompcf,ry \\n-----an:HsTr'lbutor----- --- : TnTra-apercii~an _____ _ \\n: i at Distribu \\n1 \\nI \\nI\"),\n",

Supply chain opera\\xad\\ntions include manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation, among others. With the \\nintracompany intrafunctional scope, the strategic fit is expanded to include all opera\\xad\\ntions within a function. In this case, the warehousing manager no longer minimizes \\nwarehousing costs while the transportation manager independently minimizes trans\\xad\\nportation costs. By working together and developing a joint strategy, the two minimize \\nthe total functional cost. \\nApplying the intracompany intrafunctional scope and continuing with the distri\\xad\\nbution example, managers now look not only at transportation costs, but also at ware\\xad\\nhousing and other supply chain-related costs. Although truckload transportation saves \\nthe company $4/item, it costs an additional $8/item because of increased inventory and \\nwarehousing costs. Therefore, it costs less for the company to ship each item individu\\xad\\nally because the extra $4 transportation charge saves the company $8 in inventory\\xad\\nrelated costs. \\nIn this case the scope of strategic fit expands to an entire function within a stage of \\nthe supply chain. Figure 2-9 shows the intracompany intrafunctional scope as it applies \\nto the supply chain strategy at the distributor. \\nINTRACOMPANY INTERFUNCTIONAL SCOPE: THE MAXIMIZE \\nCOMPANY PROFIT VIEW \\nThe key weakness of the intracompany intrafunctional view is that different functions \\nmay have conflicting objectives. Over time, companies became aware of this weakness \\nas they saw, for example, marketing and sales focusing on revenue generation, and \\nmanufacturing and distribution focusing on cost reduction. Actions the two functions \\ntook were often in conflict, hurting the firm\\'s overall performance. Companies realized \\nthe importance of expanding the scope of strategic fit across all functions within the \\nfirm. With the intracompany interfunctional scope, the goal is to maximize company \\nprofit. To achieve this goal, all functional strategies are developed to support both each \\nother and the competitive strategy. \\nHow does this change manifest itself? To return to our example, instead of looking \\nonly at the supply chain costs, the company will now look at revenue as well. Although \\nthe company had already decided to ship individual units to bring down inventory \\ncosts, marketing wanted to increase inventory so the company could take advantage of \\nincreased sales as a result of higher service levels. If the revenues and margins gained \\nfrom holding more inventory outweigh the additional costs, the company should go \\nahead and increase inventory. The basic point is that both operational and marketing \\ndecisions have revenue and cost impact. They must thus be coordinated. The intracom\\xad\\npany interfunctional scope of strategic fit as it applies to the distributor is shown in \\nFigure 2-9. f \\nINTERCOMPANY INTERFUNCTIONAL SCO E: THE MAXIMIZE \\nSUPPLY CHAIN SURPLUS VIEW \\nThe intracompany interfunctional scope of strategic fit has two major weaknesses. \\nFirst, it leads to each stage of the supply chain trying to maximize its own profits, which \\ndoes not necessarily result in the maximization of supply chain surplus. Supply chain \\nsurplus is maximized only when all supply\" chain stages coordinate strategy together. \\nThis occurs with the intercompany interfunctional scope, in which all stages of the'),\n",

Today, more and more com\\xad\\npanies are succeeding not because they have the lowest priced product and not \\nbecause they have the highest-quality or best-performing product, but because they \\nare able to respond quickly to market needs and get the right product to the right cus\\xad\\ntomer at the right time. Companies like Zara, the Spanish apparel retailer, have used \\nspeed as their primary competitive advantage to succeed in the marketplace. \\nThis shift toward speed has forced companies to ask what creates the level of \\nspeed that customers are demanding. When this question is examined, the answer for \\nmost companies lies to a large extent outside their own boundaries. The most signifi\\xad\\ncant delays are created at the interface between the boundaries of different stages of a \\nsupply chain. Thus, managing these interfaces becomes key to providing quick \\nresponse to customers. The intracompany scope restricts strategic attention within \\neach stage of the supply chain, leading to the interfaces being neglected. The intercom\\xad\\npany scope forces every stage of the supply chain to look across the supply chain and \\nevaluate the impact of its actions on other stages as well as on the interfaces. The inter\\xad\\ncompany scope allows the supply chain to raise the supply chain surplus and increase \\nthe size of the pie that all stages have to share among themselves. \\nThe intercompany interfunctional scope of strategic fit is shown in Figure 2-9. \\nKEY POINT The intercolllpanyscope of strategic fit is essentiaiJodaybecause the \\ncompetitive Playing field h;as shifted fr.om company versus company·tosupply chain \\nversus supply chain. Acorr1pany's partners in thesupply chain inaywell determine the· \\ncompany's success, as the company is intimately tied to its supply chain. \\nTaking this view requires each company to evaluate its actions in the context of the \\nentire supply chain. This means treating stages in the supply chain that a company does \\nnot own as belonging to the company. For example, a supply chain theme that has \\nreceived a great deal of press in recent years is the r ·on of inventory. Many com\\xad\\npanies strive to reduce their own inventories because they ass e that the less inven\\xad\\ntory they have, the better. This assumption has led to a rash of changes in ownership of \\ninventory from stage to stage in the supply chain without necessarily achieving any real \\nreduction in overall inventory. Manufacturers feel that if they force their suppliers to own \\nthe parts inventory, they will not have to finance this inventory and therefore their costs \\nwill go down. In many cases, however, the suppliers simply take ownership of the parts \\ninventory without making any changes in the way this inventory is managed. Because \\nholding this inventory increases the suppliers' costs, they are forced to raise their prices to \\nthe manufacturer or lower their margins. In the end, there is no real increase in supply \\nchain surplus because the supply chain merely shifts costs back and forth between its links. \\nThe intercompany interfunctional scope proposes a different approach. Instead of \\njust forcing the inventory on the supplier, who then increases price, the manufacturer \\nand the supplier need to work together to actually reduce the amount of inventory that \\nis required. For example, by sharing demand information with the supplier, the manu\\xad\\nfacturer can lower the amount of inventory needed in the chain, thus reducing overall \\ncost, increasing the supply chain surplus, and making firms in that supply chain more \\ncompetitive. \\nThis result will allow the supply chain to either increase profits by sharing the extra \\nsurplus or reduce price by passing along some of the surplus to the customer.

This broad scope increases the size of \\nthe surplus to be shared among all stages of the supply chain. \\nAGILE INTERCOMPANY INTERFUNCTIONAL SCOPE \\nUp to this point, we have discussed strategic fit in a static context; that is, the players in a \\nsupply chain and the customer needs do not change over time. In reality, the situation is \\nmuch more dynamic. Product life cycles are getting shorter and companies must satisfy \\nthe changing needs of individual customers. A company may have to partner with many \\ndifferent firms, depending on the product being produced and the customer being \\nserved. The strategy and operations at firms must be agile enough to maintain strategic \\nfit in a changing environment. \\nAgile intercompany scope refers to a firm's ability to achieve strategic fit when \\npartnering with supply chain stages that change over time. Firms must think in terms of \\nsupply chains consisting of many players at each stage. For example, a manufacturer \\nmay interface with a different set of suppliers and distributors depending on the prod\\xad\\nuct being produced and the customer being served. Furthermore, as customer needs \\nvary over time, firms must have the ability to become part of new supply chains while \\nensuring strategic fit. This level of agility becomes more important as the competitive \\nenvironment becomes more dynamic. \\n2.4 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Explain why achieving strategic fit is critical to a company's overall success. \\nA lack of strategic fit between the competitive and supply chain strategy can result in \\nthe supply chain taking actions that are not consistent with c er needs, leading to a \\nreduction in supply chain surplus and decreasing supply chain profit ·lity. Strategic fit \\nrequires that all functions within a firm and stages in the supply chain targef'the same goal, \\none that is consistent with customer needs. \\n2. Describe how a company achieves strategic fit between its supply chain strategy and its com\\xad\\npetitive strategy. \\nTo achieve strategic fit, a company must first understand the needs of the customers \\nbeing served, understand the uncertainty of the supply chain, and identify the implied uncer\\xad\\ntainty. The second step is to understand the supply chain's capabilities in terms of efficiency \\nand responsiveness. The key to strategic fit is ensuring that supply chain responsiveness is \\nconsistent with customer needs, supply capabilities, and the resulting implied uncertainty. \\n3. Discuss the importance of expanding the scope of strategic fit across the supply chain. \\nThe scope of strategic fit refers to the functions and stages within a supply chain that \\ncoordinate strategy and target a common goal. When the scope is narrow, individual func\\xad\\ntions try to optimize their performance based on their own goals. This practice often results \\nin conflicting actions that reduce the supply chain surplus. As the scope of strategic fit is \\nenlarged to include the entire supply chain, actions are evaluated based on their impact on \\noverall supply chain performance, which helps increase supply chain surplus. \\nr \\nl\"),\n",

Identify the major drivers of supply chain performance. \\n2. Discuss the role each driver plays in creating strategic fit between the supply chain strategy \\nand the competitive strategy. \\n3. Define the key metrics that track the performance of the supply chain in terms of each driver. \\n4. Describe the major obstacles that must be overcome to manage a supply chain successfully. \\nI\\nn this chapter, we introduce the three logistical drivers-facilities, inventory, and \\n!!:ansportatiQn-and the three cross-functional drivers-information, sourcing, and \\np.tiQ.ng-that determine the performance of any supply chain. We discuss how these \\ndrivers are used in the design, planning, and operation of the supply chain. We define \\nseveral metrics that can be used to gauge the performance of each driver. We also \\nintroduce many of the obstacles faced by supply chain managers. \\n3.1 DRIVERS OF SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE \\nThe strategic fit discussed in Chapter 2 requires that a company's supply chain achieve the \\nbalance between responsiveness and efficiency that best meets the needs of the company's \\ncompetitive strategy. To understand how a company can improve supply chain perfor\\xad\\nmance in terms of responsiveness and efficiency, we must examine the logistical and cross\\xad\\nfunctional drivers of supply chain performance: facilities, inventory, transportation, infor\\xad\\nmation, sourcing, and pricing. These drivers interact with each other to determine the \\nsupply chain's performance in terms of responsiveness and efficiency. As a result, the struc\\xad\\nture of these drivers determines if and how strategic fit is achieved across the supply chain. \\nFirst we define each driver and discuss its impact on the performance of the supply \\nchain. \\n1. Facilities are the actual physical locations in the supply chain network where \\nI_:lroduct i~d, assembled, or fabricated. The two major types of facilities are pro\\xad\\n~~s and s~s. Qecisions regarding the role, location, c~and \\nflexibility of facilities have a significant impact on the supply chain's performance. \\nFor instance, an auto-parts distributor striving for responsiveness could have many \\nwarehousing facilities located close to customers even though this practice reduces \\nefficiency. Alternatively, a high-efficiency distributor would have fewer warehouses \\nto increase efficiency despite the fact that this practice will reduce responsiveness.\"),\n",

Inventory encompasses all raw materials, work in process, and finished goods within a \\nsupply chain. Changing inventory policies can dramatically alter the supply cham's effi\\xad\\nciency and responsiveness. For example, a clothing retailer can make itself more respon\\xad\\nsive by stocking large amounts of inventory and satisfying customer demand from stock. \\nA large inventory, however, increases the retailer's cost, thereby making it less efficient. \\nReducing inventory makes the retailer more efficient but hurts its responsiveness. \\n3. Transportation entails moving inventory from point to point in the supply chain. \\nTransportation can take the form of many combinations of modes and routes, each with \\nits own performance characteristics. Transportation choices have a large impact on sup\\xad\\nply chain responsiveness and efficiency. For example, a mail-order catalog company can \\nuse a faster mode of transportation such as FedEx to ship products, thus making its sup\\xad\\nply chain more responsive, but also less efficient given the high costs associated with \\nusing FedEx. Or the company can use slower but cheaper ground transportation to ship \\nthe product, making the supply chain efficient but limiting its responsiveness. \\n4. Information consists of data and analysis concerning facilities, inventory, transporta\\xad\\ntion, costs, prices, and customers throughout the supply chain. Information is poten\\xad\\ntially the biggest driver of performance in the supply chain because it directly affects \\neach of the other drivers. Information presents management with the opportunity to \\nmake supply chains more responsive and more efficient. For example, with information \\non customer demand patterns, a pharmaceutical company can produce and stock drugs \\nin anticipation of customer demand, which makes the supply chain very responsive \\nbecause customers will find the drugs they need when they need them. This demand \\ninformation can also make the supply chain more efficient because the pharmaceutical \\nfirm is better able to forecast demand and produce only the required amount. \\nInformation can also make this supply chain more efficient by providing managers \\nwith shipping options, for instance, that allow them to choose the lowest-cost alterna\\xad\\ntive while still meeting the necessary service requirements. \\n5. Sourcing is the choice of who will perform a particular supply chain activity such as pro\\xad\\nduction, storage, transportation, or the management of information. At the strategic level, \\nthese decisions determine what functions a firm performs and what functions the firm out\\xad\\nsources. Sourcing decisions affect both the responsiveness and efficiency of a supply chain. \\nAfter Motorola outsourced much of its production to contract manufacturers in China, it \\nsaw its efficiency improve but its responsiveness suffer because of the long distances. To \\nmake up for the drop in responsiveness, Motorola started flying in some of its cell phones \\nfrom China even though this choice increased transportation cost. Flextronics, an elec\\xad\\ntronics contract manufacturer, is hoping to offer both responsive and efficient sourcing \\noptions to its customers. It is trying to make its production facilities in the United States \\nvery responsive while keeping its facilities in low-cost countries efficient. Flextronics \\nhopes to become an effective source for all customers using this combination of facilities. \\n6. Pricing determines how much a firm will charge for goods and services that it makes \\navailable in the supply chain. Pricing affects the behavior of the buyer of the good or \\nservice, thus affecting supply chain performance. For example, if a transportation com\\xad\\npany varies its charges based on the lead time provided by the customers, it is very \\nlikely that customers who value efficiency will order early and customers who value \\nresponsiveness will be willing to wait and order just before they need a product trans\\xad\\nported.

While logistics \\nremains a major part, supply chain management is increasingly becoming focused on the \\nthree cross-functional drivers. \\nIt is important to realize that these drivers do not act independently but interact \\nwith each other to determine the overall supply chain performance. Good supply chain \\ndesign and operation recognizes this interaction and makes the appropriate trade-offs \\nto deliver the desired level of responsiveness. Consider, for example, the furniture \\nindustry in the United States. Low-cost furniture sourced from Asia is available at \\nmany discount retailers. The primary goal of this supply chain is to deliver a low price \\nand acceptable quality. Variety is typically low and retailers such as Wal-Mart stock \\ninventory of finished goods. The low variety and stable replenishment orders allow \\nfurniture manufacturers in Asia to focus on efficiency. Given the available inven\\xad\\ntory, low-cost modes of transportation from Asia are used. In this instance, relatively \\nlow-cost inventory at the retailer allows the supply chain to become efficient by lower\\xad\\ning transportation and production costs. In contrast, some U.S. furniture makers have \\nchosen to focus on providing variety. Given the high variety and high prices, keeping \\ninventory of all variants at a retailer would be very expensive. In this case the supply \\nchain has been designed so the retailer carries very little inventory. Customers place \\ntheir orders with the retailer by seeing one variant of the furniture and selecting among \\nthe various options. The supply chain is made responsive by using information technol\\xad\\nogy to convey order information effectively, structuring very flexible manufacturing \\nfacilities to be able to produce in small lots, and using responsive transportation to \\ndeliver the furniture to the customer. In this instance, responsive facilities, transporta\\xad\\ntion, and information are used to lower inventory costs. As the following chapter will \\nillustrate, the key to achieving strategic fit across the supply chain is to structure the \\nsupply chain drivers appropriately to provide the desired level of responsiveness. \\nBefore we discuss each of the six drivers in detail, we put these drivers into a \\nframework that helps to clarify the role of each driver in improving supply chain \\nperformance. \\n3.2 FRAMEWORK FOR STRUCTURING DRIVERS \\nRecall from Chapter 2 that the goal of a supply chain strategy is to strike the balance \\nbetween responsiveness and efficiency that fits with the competitive strategy. To reach \\nthis goal, a company must structure the right combination of the three logistical and \\nthree cross-functional drivers discussed earlier. For each of the individual drivers, sup\\xad\\nply chain managers must make a trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness \\nbased on interaction with the other drivers. The combined impact of these drivers then \\ndetermines the responsiveness and the profits of the entire supply chain. \\nWe provide a visual framework for supply chain decision making in Figure 3-1. \\nMost companies begin with a competitive strategy and then decide what their supply \\nchain strategy ought to be. The supply chain strategy determines how the supply chain \\nshould perform with respect to efficiency and responsiveness. The supply chain must \\nthen use the three logistical and three cross-functional drivers to reach the perfor\\xad\\nmance level the supply chain strategy dictates and maximize the supply chain profits. \\nAlthough this framework is generally viewed from the top down, in many instances, a \\nstudy of the six drivers may indicate the need to change the supply chain and potentially \\neven the competitive strategy. \\nConsider this framework using Wal-Mart as an example. Wal-Mart's competitive \\nstrategy is to be a reliable, low-cost retailer for a wide variety of mass-consumption\"),\n",

This strategy dictates that the ideal supply chain will emphasize efficiency but \\nalso maintain an adequate level of responsiveness. Wal-Mart uses the three logistical \\nand three cross-functional drivers effectively to achieve this type of supply chain per\\xad\\nformance. With the inventory driver, Wal-Mart maintains an efficient supply chain by \\nkeeping low levels of inventory. For instance, Wal-Mart pioneered cross-dockigg, a sys\\xad\\ntem in which inventory is not stocked in a warehouse but ratherlsSli1pped to stores \\nfrom the manufacturer. These shipments make only brief stops at distribution centers \\n(DCs), where they are transferred to trucks that make deliveries to stores. This signifi\\xad\\ncantly lowers inventory because products are stocked only at stores, not at both stores \\nand warehouses. With respect to inventory, Wal-Mart favors efficiency over responsive\\xad\\nness. On the transportation front, Wal-Mart runs its own fleet, to keep responsiveness \\nhigh. This increases transportation cost, but the benefits in terms of reduced inventory \\nand improved product availability justify this cost in Wal-Mart's case. In the case of \\nfacilities, Wal-Mart uses centrally located DCs within its network of stores to decrease \\nthe number of facilities and increase efficiency at each DC. Wal-Mart builds retail \\nstores only where the demand is sufficient to justify having several of them supported \\nby a DC, thereby increasing efficiency of its transportation assets. To utilize informa\\xad\\ntion in the supply chain, Wal-Mart has invested significantly more than its competitors \\nin information technology. As a result, Wal-Mart is a leader in its use of the informa\\xad\\ntion driver to improve responsiveness and decrease inventory investment.

With regard to the sourcing driver, Wal-Mart \\nidentifies efficient sources for each product it sells. Wal-Mart feeds them large orders, \\nallowing them to be efficient by exploiting economies of scale. Finally, for the pricing \\ndriver, Wal-Mart practices \"every day low pricing\" (EDLP) for its products. This \\nensures that customer demand stays steady and does not fluctuate with price varia\\xad\\ntions. The entire supply chain then focuses on meeting this demand in an efficient man\\xad\\nner. Wal-Mart uses all the supply chain drivers to achieve the right balance between \\nresponsiveness and efficiency so that its competitive strategy and supply chain strategy \\nare in harmony. \\nWe devote the next six sections to a detailed discussion of each of the three logisti\\xad\\ncal and three cross-functional drivers and their roles in the supply chain. \\n3.3 FACILITIES \\nIn this section, we discuss the role that facilities play in the supply chain as well as crit\\xad\\nical facility-related decisions that supply chain managers need to make. \\nROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nIf we think of inventory as what is being passed along the supply chain and transporta\\xad\\ntion as how it is passed along, then facilities are the where of the supply chain. They are \\nthe locations to or from which the inventory is transported. Within a facility, inventory \\nis either transformed into another state (manufacturing) or it is stored (warehousing). \\nROLE IN THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY \\nFacilities are a key driver of supply chain performance in terms of responsiveness and \\nefficiency. For example, companies can gain economies of scale when a product is man\\xad\\nufactured or stored in only one location; this centralization increases efficiency. The \\ncost reduction, however, comes at the expense of responsiveness, as many of a com\\xad\\npany\\'s customers may be located far from the production facility. The opposite is also \\ntrue. Locating facilities close to customers increases the number of facilities needed \\nand consequently reduces efficiency. If the customer demands and is willing to pay for \\nthe responsiveness that having numerous facilities adds, however, then this facilities \\ndecision helps meet the company\\'s competitive strategy goals. \\nExample 3-1: Toyota and Honda \\nBoth Toyota and Honda use facilities decisions to be more responsive to their customers. \\nThese companies have an end goal of opening manufacturing facilities in every major mar\\xad\\nket that they enter. While there are other benefits to opening local facilities, such as protec\\xad\\ntion from currency fluctuation and trade barriers, the increase in responsiveness plays a \\nlarge role in Toyota and Honda\\'s decision to place facilities in their local markets. \\nCOMPONENTS OF FACILITIES DECISIONS \\nDecisions regarding facilities are a crucial part of supply chain design. We now identify \\ncomponents of facilities decisions that companies must analyze. \\nRole \\nFor production facilities, firms must decide whether they will be flexible, dedicated, or \\na combination of the two. Flexible capacity can be used for many types of products but'),\n",

Firms must also decide whether to design a facil\\xad\\nity with a product focus or a functional focus. A product-focused facility performs \\nmany different functions (e.g., fabrication and assembly) in producing a single type of \\nproduct. A functional-focused facility performs few functions (e.g., only fabrication or \\nonly assembly) on many types of products. A product focus tends to result in more \\nexpertise about a particular type of product at the expense of the functional expertise \\nthat comes from a functional methodology. \\nFor warehouses and DCs, firms must decide whether they will be primarily cross\\xad\\ndocking facilities or storage facilities. At cross-docking facilities, inbound trucks from \\nsuppliers are unloaded; the product is broken into smaller lots, and is quickly loaded \\nonto store-bound trucks. Each store-bound truck carries a variety of products, some \\nfrom each inbound truck. For storage facilities, firms must decide on the products to be \\nstored at each facility. \\nLocation \\nDeciding where a company will locate its facilities constitutes a large part of the design \\nof a supply chain. A basic trade-off here is whether to centralize in order to gain \\neconomies of scale or to decentralize to become more responsive by being closer to the \\ncustomer. Companies must also consider a host of issues related to the various charac\\xad\\nteristics of the local area in which the facility is situated. These include macroeconomic \\nfactors, quality of workers, cost of workers, cost of facility, availability of infrastructure, \\nproximity to customers, the location of that firm's other facilities, tax effects, and other \\nstrategic factors. \\nCapacity \\nCompanies must also determine a facility's capacity to perform its intended function or \\nfunctions. A large amount of excess capacity allows the facility to be very flexible and \\nto respond to wide swings in the demands placed on it. Excess capacity, however, costs \\nmoney and therefore can decrease efficiency. A facility with little excess capacity will \\nlikely be more efficient per unit of product it produces than one with a lot of unused \\ncapacity. The high-utilization facility, however, will have difficulty responding to \\ndemand fluctuations. Therefore, a company must make a trade-off to determine the \\nright amount of capacity to have at each of its facilities. \\nFacility-Related Metrics \\nA managershould track the following facility-related metrics that influence supply \\nchain performance. \\n• Capacity measures the maximum amount a facility can process. \\n• Utilization measures the fraction of capacity that is currently being used in the \\nfacility. Utilization affects both the unit cost of processing and the associated \\ndelays. Unit costs tend to decline and delays increase with increasing utilization. \\n• Theoretical flow/cycle time of production measures the time required to process \\na unit if there are absolutely no delays at any stage. \\n• Actual average flow/cycle time measures the average actual time taken for all \\nunits processed over a specified duration such as a week or month. The actual \\nflow/cycle time includes the theoretical time and any delays. \\n• Flow time efficiency is the ratio of the theoretical flow time to the actual average \\nflow time. \\n• Product variety measures the number of products/product families processed in a \\nfacility. Processing costs and flow times are likely to increase with product variety.\"),\n",

An 80/20 outcome in which the top 20 percent contribute 80 percent of \\nvolume indicates likely benefits from focusing the facility where separate processes \\nare used to process the top 20 percent and the remaining 80 percent. \\n• Processing/setup/down/idle time measure the fraction of time that the facility \\nwas processing units, being set up to process units, unavailable because it was \\ndown, or idle because it had no units to process. \\n• Average production batch size measures the average amount produced in each \\nproduction batch. Large batch sizes will decrease production cost but increase \\ninventories in the supply chain. \\n• Production service level measures the fraction of production orders completed \\non time and in full. \\nOVERALL TRADE-OFF: RESPONSIVENESS VERSUS EFFICIENCY \\nThe fundamental trade-off that managers face when making facilities decisions is \\nbetween the cost of the number, location, and type of facilities (efficiency) and the level \\nof responsiveness that these facilities provide the company's customers. Increasing the \\nnumber of facilities increases facility and inventory costs but decreases transportation \\ncosts and reduces response time. Increasing the flexibility of a facility increases facility \\ncosts but decreases inventory costs and response time. \\n3.4 INVENTORY \\nIn this section we discuss the role that inventory plays in the supply chain and how \\nmanagers use inventory to drive supply chain performance. \\nROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nInventory exists in the supply chain because of a mismatch between supply and \\ndemand. This mismatch is intentional at a steel manufacturer, where it is economical \\nto manufacture in large lots that are then stored for future sales. The mismatch is \\nalso intentional at a retail store where inventory is held in anticipation of future \\ndemand. An important role that inventory plays in the supply chain is to increase \\nthe amount of demand that can be satisfied by having the product ready and avail\\xad\\nable when the customer wants it. Another significant role that inventory plays is to \\nreduce cost by exploiting economies of scale that may exist during production and \\ndistribution. \\nInventory is held throughout the supply chain in the form of raw materials, work in \\nprocess, and finished goods. Inventory is a major source of cost in a supply chain and \\nhas a huge impact on responsiveness. If we think of the responsiveness spectrum dis\\xad\\ncussed in Chapter 2, the location and quantity of inventory can move the supply chain \\nfrom one end of the spectrum to the other. For example, an apparel supply chain with \\nhigh inventory levels at the retail stage has a high level of responsiveness because a \\nconsumer can walk into a store and walk out with the shirt he or she was looking for. In \\ncontrast, an apparel supply chain with little inventory could be very efficient but would \\nmake customers wait several weeks or even months for their clothes. \\nInventory also has a significant impact on the material flow time in a supply chain. \\nMaterial flow time is the time that elapses between the point at which material enters\"),\n",

For a supply chain, throughput is the rate \\nat which sales occur. If inventory is represented byl, flow time by T, and throughput by \\nD, the three can be related using Little's law as follows: ~ \\n' \\\\\\\\· '-< \\nl=DT (3.1) \\nFor example, if the flow time of an auto assembly process is 10 hours and the \\nthroughput is 60 units an hour, Little's law tells us that the inventory is 60 X 10 = 600 \\nunits. If we were able to reduce inventory to 300 units while holding throughput con\\xad\\nstant, we would reduce our flow time to five hours (300/60). We note that in this rela\\xad\\ntionship, inventory and throughput must have consistent units. \\nThe logical conclusion here is that inventory and flow time are synonymous in a \\nsupply chain because throughput is often determined by customer demand. Managers \\nshould use actions that lower the amount of inventory needed without increasing cost \\nor reducing responsiveness, because reduced flow time can be a significant advantage \\nin a supply chain. \\nROLE IN THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY \\nInventory plays a significant role in a supply chain's ability to support a firm's com\\xad\\npetitive strategy. If a firm's competitive strategy requires a very high level of \\nresponsiveness, a company can achieve this responsiveness by locating large \\namounts of inventory close to the customer. Conversely, a company can also use \\ninventory to become more efficient by reducing inventory through centralized \\nstocking. The latter strategy would support a competitive strategy of being a low\\xad\\ncost producer. The trade-off implicit in the inventory driver is between the respon\\xad\\nsiveness that results from more inventory and the efficiency that results from less \\ninventory. \\nExample 3-2: Nordstrom \\nNordstrom's competitive strategy targets upper-end customers with high responsiveness \\nrequirements. These customers are willing to pay a premium to have the products they \\nwant when they want them. To support this competitive strategy, Nordstrom uses inven\\xad\\ntory; the company stocks a large variety and quantity of products to ensure a high level of \\navailability. In fact, Nordstrom stocks a significantly larger amount of inventory than other \\ndepartment stores. Nordstrom incurs higher costs because of its large inventory, but it \\ngains extra margin from its customers, who are willing to pay for the level of service that \\nNordstrom's inventory makes possible. \\nCOMPONENTS OF INVENTORY DECISIONS \\nWe now identify major inventory-related decisions that supply chain managers must \\nmake to effectively create more responsive and more efficient supply chains. \\nCycle Inventory \\nCycle inventory is the average amount of inventory used to satisfy demand between \\nreceipts of supplier shipments. The size of the cycle inventory is a result of the pro\\xad\\nduction, transportation, or purchase of material in large lots. Companies produce or \\npurchase in large lots to exploit economies of scale in the production, transporta\\xad\\ntion, or purchasing process. With the increase in lot size, however, also comes an \\nincrease in carrying costs. As an example of a cycle stock decision, consider an \\nonline book retailer. This retailer's sales average around 10 truckloads of books a \\nmonth. The cycle inventory decisions the retailer must make are how much to order \\nfor replenishment and how often to place these orders. Thee-retailer could order 10 \\ntruckloads once each month or it could order one truckload every three days. The basic\"),\n",

If the world were perfectly predictable, only cycle inventory would \\nbe needed. Because demand is uncertain and may exceed expectations, however, compa\\xad\\nnies hold safety inventory to satisfy an unexpectedly high demand. Managers face a key \\ndecision when determining how much safety inventory to hold. For example, a toy \\nretailer such as Toys \"R\" Us must calculate its safety inventory for the holiday buying \\nseason. If it has too much safety inventory, toys go unsold and may have to be discounted \\nafter the holidays. If the company has too little safety inventory, however, then Toys \"R\" \\nUs loses sales, along with the margin those sales would have brought. Therefore, choosing \\nsafety inventory involves making a trade-off between the costs of having too much \\ninventory and the costs of losing sales due to not having enough inventory. \\nSeasonal Inventory \\nSeasonal inventory is built up to counter predictable variability in demand. Companies \\nusing seasonal inventory build up inventory in periods of low demand and store it for \\nperiods of high demand when they will not have the capacity to produce all that is \\ndemanded. Managers face key decisions in determining whether to build seasonal \\ninventory, and if they do build it, in deciding how much to build. If a company can \\nrapidly change the rate of its production system at very low cost, then it may not need \\nseasonal inventory, because the production system can adjust to a period of high \\ndemand without incurring large costs. However, if changing the rate of production is \\nexpensive (e.g., when workers must be hired or fired), then a company would be wise \\nto establish a smooth production rate and build up its inventory during periods of low \\ndemand. Therefore, the basic trade-off supply chain managers face in determining how \\nmuch seasonal inventory to build is the cost of carrying the additional seasonal inven\\xad\\ntory versus the cost of having a more flexible production rate. \\nLevel of Product Availability \\nLevel of product availability is the fraction of demand that is served on time from prod\\xad\\nuct held in inventory. A high level of product availability provides a high level of \\nresponsiveness but increases cost because a lot of inventory is held but rarely used. In \\ncontrast, a low level of product availability lowers inventory holding cost but results in \\na higher fraction of customers who are not served on time. The basic trade-off when \\ndetermining the level of product availability is between the cost of inventory to \\nincrease product availability and the loss from not serving customers on time. \\nInventory-Related Metrics \\nA manager should track the following inventory-related metrics that influence supply \\nchain performance. \\n• Average inventory measures the average amount of inventory carried. Average \\ninventory should be measured in units, days of demand, and financial value. \\n• Products with more than a specified number of days of inventory identifies the \\nproducts for which the firm is carrying a high level of inventory. This metric can \\nbe used to identify products that are in oversupply or identify reasons that justify \\nthe high inventory, such as price discounts, or being a very slow mover. \\n• Average replenishment batch size measures the average amount in each replen\\xad\\nishment order. The batch size should be measured by SKU in terms of both units \\nf'),\n",

It can be estimated by averaging over time the difference \\nbetween the maximum and the minimum inventory (measured in each replenish\\xad\\nment cycle) on hartd. \\n• Average safety inventory measures the average amount of inventory on hand \\nwhen a replenishment order arrives. Average safety inventory should be mea\\xad\\nsured by SKU in both units and days of demand. It can be estimated by averaging \\nover time the minimum inventory on hand in each replenishment cycle. \\n• Seasonal inventory measures the amount of both cycle and safety inventory that \\nis purchased solely due to seasonal changes in demand. \\n• Fill rate measures the fraction of orders/demand that were met on time from \\ninventory. Fill rate should not be averaged over time but over a specified number \\nof units of demand (say, every thousand, million, etc.). \\n• Fraction of time out of stock measures the fraction of time that a particular SKU \\nhad zero inventory. This fraction can be used to estimate the demand during the \\nstock out period. \\nOverall Trade-Off: Responsiveness Versus Efficiency \\nThe fundamental trade-off that managers face when making inventory decisions is \\nbetween responsiveness and efficiency. Increasing inventory generally makes the sup\\xad\\nply chain more responsive to the customer. A higher level of inventory also facilitates a \\nreduction in production and transportation costs because of improved economies of \\nscale in both functions. This choice, however, increases inventory holding cost. \\n3.5 TRANSPORTATION \\nIn this section we discuss the role that transportation plays in the supply chain, as well \\nas key transportation-related decisions that supply chain managers must make. \\nROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nTransportation moves product between different stages in a supply chain. Like the \\nother supply chain drivers, transportation has a large impact on both responsiveness \\nand efficiency. Faster transportation allows a supply chain to be more responsive but \\nreduces its efficiency. The type of transportation a company uses also affects the inven\\xad\\ntory and facility locations in the supply chain. Dell, for example, flies some components \\nfrom Asia because doing so allows the company to lower the level of inventory it holds. \\nClearly, such a practice also increases responsiveness but decreases transportation effi\\xad\\nciency because it is more costly than transporting parts by ship. \\nROLE IN THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY \\nThe role of transportation in a company's competitive strategy figures prominently in \\nthe company's consideration of the target customer's needs. If a firm's competitive \\nstrategy targets a customer who demands a very high level of responsiveness, and that \\ncustomer is willing to pay for this responsiveness, then a firm can use transportation as \\none driver for making the supply chain more responsive. The opposite holds true as \\nwell. If a company's competitive strategy targets customers whose main decision crite\\xad\\nrion is price, then the company can use transportation to lower the cost of the product \\nat the expense of responsiveness. Because a company may use both inventory and \\ntransportation to increase responsiveness or efficiency, the optimal decision for the \\ncompany often means finding the right balance between the two.\"),\n",

Laura Ashley's customers are willing \\nto pay a premium price for a high level of responsiveness. To meet this level of responsive\\xad\\nness, the company has located its main warehouse near the FedEx hub in Memphis, \\nTennessee, to better utilize the responsive transportation that FedEx offers. When an order \\nis placed, the goods are easily and quickly sent from the Laura Ashley warehouse to the \\nFedEx hub, where they are sent overnight to the customer. This transportation policy \\nenables Laura Ashley's customers to order their goods later than they can at other compa\\xad\\nnies and still receive them next day. \\nCOMPONENTS OF TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS \\nWe now identify key components of transportation that companies must analyze when \\ndesigning and operating a supply chain. \\nDesign of Transportation Network \\nThe transportation network is the collection of transportation modes, locations, and \\nroutes along which product can be shipped. A company must decide whether trans\\xad\\nportation from a supply source will be direct to the demand point or will go through \\nintermediate consolidation points. Design decisions also include whether multiple sup\\xad\\nply or demand points will be included in a single run or not. Finally, companies must \\nalso decide on the set of transportation modes that will be used. \\nChoice of Transportation Mode \\nThe mode of transportation is the manner in which a product is moved from one loca\\xad\\ntion in the supply chain network to another. Companies can choose between air, truck, \\nrail, sea, and pipeline as modes of transport for products. Today, information goods can \\nalso be sent via the Internet. Each mode has different characteristics with respect to \\nthe speed, size of shipments (individual parcels to pallets to full trucks to entire ships), \\ncost of shipping, and flexibility that lead companies to choose one particular mode \\nover the others. \\nTransportation-Related Metrics \\nA manager should track the following transportation-related metrics that influence \\nsupply chain performance. \\n• Average inbound transportation cost typically measures the cost of bringing \\nproduct into a facility as a percentage of sales or cost of goods sold (COGS). \\nIdeally, this cost should be measured per unit brought in, but this can be difficult. \\nThe inbound transportation cost is generally included in COGS. It is useful to \\nseparate this cost by supplier. \\n• Average incoming shipment size measures the average number of units or dollars \\nin each incoming shipment at a facility. \\n• Average inbound transportation cost per shipment measures the average trans\\xad\\nportation cost of each incoming delivery. Along with the incoming shipment size, \\nthis metric identifies opportunities for greater economies of scale in inbound \\ntransportation. \\n• Average outbound transportation cost measures the cost of sending product out \\nof a facility to the customer. Ideally, this cost should be measured per unit shipped, \\nbut it is often measured as a percentage of sales. It is useful to separate this metric \\nby customer. \\n• Average outbound shipment size measures the average number of units or dollars \\non each outbound shipment at a facility.\"),\n",

Along with the outgoing shipment size, \\nthis metric identifies opportunities for greater economies of scale in outbound \\ntransportation. \\n• Fraction transported by mode measures the fraction of transportation (in units or \\ndollars) using each mode of transportation. This metric can be used to estimate if \\ncertain modes are overused or underutilized. \\nOverall Trade-Off: Responsiveness Versus Efficiency \\nThe fundamental trade-off for transportation is between the cost of transporting a \\ngiven product (efficiency) and the speed with which that product is transported \\n(responsiveness). Using fast modes of transport raises responsiveness and transporta\\xad\\ntion cost but lowers the inventory holding cost. \\n3.6 INFORMATION \\nIn this section we discuss the role that information plays in the supply chain, as well as \\nkey information-related decisions that supply chain managers must make. \\nROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nInformation deeply affects every part of the supply chain. Its impact is easy to under\\xad\\nestimate, as information affects a supply chain in many different ways. Consider the \\nfollowing: \\n1. Information serves as the connection between various stages of a supply chain, \\nallowing them to coordinate and maximize total supply chain profitability. \\n2. Information is also crucial to the daily operations of each stage in a supply chain. \\nFor instance, a production scheduling system uses information on demand to cre\\xad\\nate a schedule that allows a factory to produce the right products in an efficient \\nmanner. A warehouse management system uses information to create visibility of \\nthe warehouse\\'s inventory. The company can then use this information to deter\\xad\\nmine whether new orders can be filled. \\nROLE IN THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY \\nInformation is an important driver that companies have used to become both more \\nefficient and more responsive. The tremendous growth of the importance of informa\\xad\\ntion technology is a testimony to the impact that information can have on improving a \\ncompany. Like all the other drivers, however, even with information, companies reach \\na point when they must make the trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness. \\nAnother key decision involves what information is most valuable in reducing cost and \\nimproving responsiveness within a supply chain. This decision will vary depending on the \\nsupply chain structure and the market segments served. Some companies, for example, \\ntarget customers who require customized products that carry a premium price tag. These \\ncompanies might find that investments in information allow them to respond more \\nquickly to their customers. The following examples illustrate this type of investment. \\nExample 3-4: Andersen Windows \\nAndersen Windows, a major manufacturer of residential wood windows located in Bayport, \\nMinnesota, has invested in an information system that enables the company to bring cus\\xad\\ntomized products to the market rapidly. This system, called \"Window of Knowledge,\" \\nallows distributors and customers to design windows to custom-fit their needs. Users can'),\n",

The system immediately gives the customer price quotes and automatically sends \\nthe order to the factory if the customer decides to buy. This information investment not \\nonly gives the customer a much wider variety of products, it allows Andersen to be much \\nmore responsive to the customer, as it gets the customer's order to the factory as soon as \\nthe order is placed. \\nExample 3-5: Dell \\nDell takes orders directly from consumers over the phone and via the Internet. Building \\nthis direct channel required an investment because of the added functions Dell must per\\xad\\nform. A large part of that cost can be attributed to information. With the direct channel \\nmodel, however, Dell is able to view the actual consumer demand much sooner than most \\nPC manufacturers. Therefore, the company can respond more quickly to changes in con\\xad\\nsumer needs. Dell can then modify its product offerings to meet these new needs. Dell is \\nnot the low-cost provider. The company is, however, the cheapest for its level of respon\\xad\\nsiveness, and a large part of its responsiveness is due to the information flow between \\nDell and its customers, and Dell and \\nits suppliers, that is made possible by its investment \\nin information. \\nCOMPONENTS OF INFORMATION DECISIONS \\nWe now consider key components of information that a company must analyze to \\nincrease efficiency and improve responsiveness within its supply chain. \\nPush Versus Pull \\nWhen designing processes of the supply chain, managers must determine whether \\nthese processes are part of the push or pull phase in the chain. We discuss this distinc\\xad\\ntion in Chapter 1, but we mention it again because different types of systems require \\ndifferent types of information. Push systems generally require information in the form \\nof elaborate material requirements planning (MRP) systems to take the master produc\\xad\\ntion schedule and roll it back, creating schedules for suppliers with part types, quantities, \\nand delivery dates. Pull systems require information on actual demand to be transmit\\xad\\nted extremely quickly throughout the entire chain so that production and distribution \\nof products may reflect the real demand accurately. \\nCoordination and Information Sharing \\nSupply chain coordination occurs when all stages of a supply chain work toward the \\nobjective of maximizing total supply chain profitability based on shared information. \\nLack of coordination can result in a significant loss of supply chain profit. Coordination \\namong different stages in a supply chain requires each stage to share appropriate infor\\xad\\nmation with other stages. For example, if a supplier is to produce the right parts in a \\ntimely manner for a manufacturer in a pull system, the manufacturer must share \\ndemand and production information with the supplier. Information sharing is thus cru\\xad\\ncial to the success of a supply chain. \\nForecasting and Aggregate Planning \\nForecasting is the art and science of making projections about what future demand and \\nconditions will be. Obtaining forecasting information frequently means using sophisti\\xad\\ncated techniques to estimate future sales or market conditions. Managers must decide \\nhow they will make forecasts and to what extent they will rely on forecasts to make \\ndecisions. Companies often use forecasts both on a tactical level to schedule production \\nand on a strategic level to determine whether to build new plants or even whether to \\nenter a new market. \\nOnce a company creates a forecast, the company needs a plan to act on this forecast. \\nAggregate planning transforms forecasts into plans of activity to satisfy the projected \\ndemand. A key decision managers face is how to collaborate on aggregate planning\"),\n",

The aggregate plan becomes a critical piece of \\ninformation to be shared across the supply chain because it affects both the demand on \\na firm's suppliers and the supply to its customers. \\nEnabling Technologies \\nMany technologies exist to share and analyze information in the supply chain. \\nManagers must decide which technologies to use and how to integrate these technolo\\xad\\ngies into their companies and their partners' companies. The consequences of these \\ndecisions are becoming more and more important as the capabilities of these technolo\\xad\\ngies grow. Some of these technologies include the following. \\n1. Electronic data interchange (EDI) allows companies to place instantaneous, paper\\xad\\nless purchase orders with suppliers. EDI is not only efficient, it also decreases the \\ntime needed to get products to customers because transactions are faster and more \\naccurate than when they are paper based. Although EDI is a bit outdated and has \\nlimited capabilities, it still offers efficiency and responsiveness gains for some firms. \\n2. The Internet has critical advantages over EDI with respect to information sharing. \\nThe Internet conveys much more information and therefore offers much more vis\\xad\\nibility than EDI. Better visibility improves decisions across the supply chain. \\nInternet communication among stages in the supply chain is also easier because a \\nstandard infrastructure (the World Wide Web) already exists. Thanks to the \\nInternet, e-commerce has become a major force in the supply chain. \\n3. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems provide the transactional tracking \\nand global visibility of information from within a company and across its supply \\nchain. This real-time information helps a supply chain to improve the quality of its \\noperational decisions. ERP systems keep track of the information, whereas the \\nInternet provides one method with which to view this information. A more \\ndetailed discussion of ERP systems is in Chapter 17. \\n4. Supply chain management (SCM) software uses the information in ERP systems \\nto provide analytical decision support in addition to the visibility of information. \\nERP systems show a company what is going on, while SCM systems help a com\\xad\\npany decide what it should do. A more detailed discussion of SCM systems is in \\nChapter 17. \\n5. Radio frequency identification (RFID) consists of an active or passive radio fre\\xad\\nquency (RF) tag applied to the item being tracked and an RF reader/emitter. A \\npassive tag draws energy from the reader, whereas an active tag has its own battery \\nand draws power from there. Wal-Mart has mandated the use of RFID technology \\nby its top 100 suppliers at the case level. RFID has many potential uses. It can be \\nused in manufacturing to check availability of the entire bill of materials. The \\ntechnology can make the receiving of a truck much faster and cheaper. Full \\nimplementation of RFID could eliminate the need for manual counting and bar\\xad\\ncode scanning at the receiving dock. It can also be used to get an exact count of \\nincoming items and items in storage. RFID technology, however, has yet to reach \\n100 percent accuracy, and its cost per unit is still high enough to make global \\nacceptance difficult, even at the case level. \\nInformation-Related Metrics \\nA manager should track the following information-related metrics that influence sup\\xad\\nply chain performance. \\n• Forecast horizon identifies how far in advance of the actual event a forecast is \\nmade. The forecast horizon must equal the lead time of the decision that is driven \\nby the forecast.\"),\n",

The fore\\xad\\ncast should be updated somewhat more frequently than a decision will be revis\\xad\\nited, so that large changes can be flagged and corrective action taken. \\n• Forecast error measures the difference between the forecast and actual demand. \\nThe forecast error is a measure of uncertainty and drives all responses to uncer\\xad\\ntainty such as safety inventory or excess capacity. \\n• Seasonal factors measure the extent to which the average demand in a season is \\nabove or below the average in the year. \\n• Variance from plan identifies the difference between the planned \\nproduction/inventories and the actual values. These variances can be used to raise \\nflags that identify shortages and surpluses. \\n• Ratio of demand variability to order variability measures the standard devia\\xad\\ntion of incoming demand and supply orders placed. A ratio less than one poten\\xad\\ntially indicates the existence of the bullwhip effect. \\nOverall Trade-Off: Responsiveness Versus Efficiency \\nGood information can help a firm improve both its responsiveness and efficiency. The \\ninformation driver is used to improve the performance of other drivers, and the use of \\ninformation is based on the strategic position the other drivers support. Accurate infor\\xad\\nmation can help a firm improve efficiency by decreasing inventory and transportation \\ncosts. Accurate information can improve responsiveness by helping a supply chain bet\\xad\\nter match supply and demand. \\n3.7 SOURCING \\nIn this section we discuss the role that sourcing plays in the supply chain and key sourc\\xad\\ning related decisions that managers need to make. \\nROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nSourcing is the set of business processes required to purchase goods and services. \\nManagers must first decide which tasks will be outsourced and those that will be per\\xad\\nformed within the firm. For each outsourced task, the manager must decide whether to \\nsource from a single supplier or a portfolio of suppliers. If a portfolio of multiple sup\\xad\\npliers is to be carried, then the role of each supplier in the portfolio must be clarified. \\nThe next step is to identify the set of criteria that will be used to select suppliers and \\nmeasure their performance. Managers then select suppliers and negotiate contracts \\nwith them. Contracts define the role of each supply source and should be structured to \\nimprove supply chain performance and minimize information distortion from one \\nstage to the next. Once suppliers and contracts are in place, procurement processes \\nthat facilitate the placement and delivery of orders play a major role. \\nROLE IN THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY \\nSourcing decisions are crucial because they affect the level of efficiency and respon\\xad\\nsiveness the supply chain can achieve. In some instance, firms outsource to responsive \\nthird parties if it is too expensive for them to develop this responsiveness on their own. \\nAn example is the outsourcing of next-day delivery by all firms to a few package car\\xad\\nriers because it is too expensive for a firm to develop next-day delivery capability on \\nits own. In other instances firms have kept the responsive process in-house, to main\\xad\\ntain control. An example of this is Benetton, which keeps the dyeing of knit garments'),\n",

Firms also outsource for \\nefficiency if the third party can achieve significant economies of scale or has a lower \\nunderlying cost structure for other reasons. Outsourcing decisions should be driven by \\nthe desire for growth in total supply chain profitability. \\nExample 3-6: Cisco \\nCisco has outsourced almost all of its manufacturing. It does, however, have a sourcing \\nstrategy that varies by product type. For low-end products such as routers for home net\\xad\\nworks, Cisco aims for efficiency. These routers are produced and packed in China and \\nshipped in bulk for sale in the United States. Cisco aims for the lowest-cost manufacturing \\nlocation and economies of scale in transportation because the targeted market segment \\nvalues low cost. For high-end products, in contrast, Cisco outsources to contract manu\\xad\\nfacturers in the United States. These manufacturers are not cheap but they are responsive \\nand can serve the rapidly evolving needs of the high-end market. \\nCOMPONENTS OF SOURCING DECISIONS \\nWe now consider key sourcing decisions that are made within a firm. \\nIn-House or Outsource \\nThe most significant sourcing decision for a firm is whether to perform a task in-house \\nor outsource itto a third party. This decision should be driven in part by its impact on \\nthe total supply chain profit. It is best to outsource if the growth in total supply chain \\nprofit is significant with little additional risk. Within a task such as transportation, man\\xad\\nagers must decide whether to outsource all of it, outsource only the responsive compo\\xad\\nnent, or outsource only the efficient component. Once again, the decision should be \\nbased in part on the growth in total supply chain profitability. \\nSupplier Selection \\nManagers must decide on the number of suppliers they will have for a particular activ\\xad\\nity. They must then identify the criteria along which suppliers will be evaluated and \\nhow they will be selected. For the selection process, managers must decide whether \\nthey will use direct negotiations or resort to an auction. If an auction is used, it must be \\nstructured to ensure the desired outcome. \\nProcurement \\nProcurement is the process in which the supplier sends product in response to cus\\xad\\ntomer orders. Managers must decide on the structure of procurement of direct as well \\nas indirect materials, and strategic as well as general materiais. In each case, it is impor\\xad\\ntant to identify the critical mechanism for increasing supply chain profits. For example, \\na firm should set up procurement for direct materials to ensure good coordination \\nbetween the supplier and buyer. In contrast, the procurement of MRO products should \\nbe structured to ensure that transaction costs are low. ' · R!' \\n~. (\\\\ ~~ I . (': r' .; ~ 'r_~ \\nSourcing-Related Metrics \\nA manager should track the following sourcing related metrics that influence supply \\nchain performance. \\n• Days payable outstanding measures the number of days between when a supplier \\nperformed a supply chain task and when it was paid. \\n• Average purchase price measures the average price at which a good or service was \\npurchased during the year. The average price should be weighted by the quantity \\npurchased at each price. \\n• Range of purchase price measures the fluctuation in purchase price during a speci\\xad\\nfied period.

The \\ngoal is to identify whether a sufficient level of aggregation is occurring across \\nlocations when placing an order. \\n• Fraction on-time deliveries measures the fraction of deliveries from the supplier \\nthat were on time. \\n• Supply quality measures the quality of product supplied. \\n• Supply lead time measures the average time between when an order is placed \\nand the product arrives. \\nOverall Trade-Off: Increase the Supply Chain Profits \\nSourcing decisions should be made to increase the size of the total profit to be shared \\nacross the supply chain. The total profits are affected by the impact of sourcing on \\nsales, service, production costs, inventory costs, transportation costs, and information \\ncosts. Outsourcing to a third party is meaningful if the third party raises the supply \\nchain profits more than the firm can by its own. In contrast, a firm should keep a sup\\xad\\nply chain function in-house if the third party cannot increase the supply chain profits or \\nif the risk associated with outsourcing is significant. \\nIn this section we discuss the role that pricing plays in the supply chain. \\nROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nPricing is the process by which a firm decides how much to charge customers for its goods \\nand services. Pricing affects the customer segments that choose to buy the product, as well \\nas the customer's expectations. This directly affects the supply chain in terms of the level \\nof responsiveness required as well as the demand profile that the supply chain attempts to \\nserve. Pricing is also a lever that can be used to match supply and demand. Short-term dis\\xad\\ncounts can be used to eliminate supply surpluses or decrease seasonal demand spikes by \\nmoving some of the demand forward. In short, pricing is one of the most significant factors \\nthat affect the level and type of demand that the supply chain will face. \\nROLE IN THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY \\nPricing is a significant attribute through which a firm executes its competitive strategy. \\nFor example, Costco, a membership-based wholesaler in the United States, has a policy \\nthat prices are kept steady but low. Customers expect low prices but are comfortable \\nwith a lower level of product availability. The steady prices also ensure that demand \\nstays relatively stable. Costco serves a well-defined segment, and it can thus design an \\nappropriate supply chain. The Costco supply chain aims to be very efficient, at the \\nexpense of some responsiveness. In contrast, some manufacturing and transportation \\nfirms use pricing that varies with the response time desired by the customer. Through \\ntheir pricing, these firms are targeting a broader set of customers, some of whom need \\nresponsiveness while others need efficiency. In this case it becomes important for these \\nfirms to structure a supply chain that can meet the two divergent needs. \\nExample 3-7: Amazon \\nAmazon offers its customers a large menu of prices for products that are purchased from the \\ncompany. For example, in November 2005, a person purchasing two books worth $30 could \\nuse standard shipping (ships in 3-5 business days) at a cost of $4.98, two-day shipping \\n(ships in 2 business days) at a cost of $11.47, one-day shipping (ships in 1 business day) \\nat a cost of $20.47 or use free shipping (ships in 7-14 business days).

The discount moves some of the December \\ndemand forward, allowing it to reduce its December peak and improve its efficiency with\\xad\\nout giving up on responsiveness for those customers who do not want to order earlier. \\nCOMPONENTS OF PRICING DECISIONS \\nWe now describe key components of pricing decisions that affect supply chain perfor\\xad\\nmance. \\nPricing and Economies of Scale \\nMost supply chain activities display economies of scale. Changeovers make small pro\\xad\\nduction runs more expensive per unit than large production runs. Loading and unload\\xad\\ning costs make it cheaper to deliver a truckload to one location than four. In each case, \\nthe provider of the supply chain activity must decide how to price it appropriately to \\nreflect these economies of scale. A commonly used approach is to offer quantity dis\\xad\\ncounts. Care must be taken to ensure that quantity discounts offered are consistent \\nwith the economies of scale in the underlying process. Otherwise there is a danger of \\ncustomer orders being driven primarily by the quantity discounts even though the \\nunderlying process does not have significant economies of scale. \\nEveryday Low Pricing Versus High-Low Pricing \\nA firm such as Costco practices everyday low pricing at its warehouse stores, keeping \\nprices steady over time. Costco will go to the extent of not offering any discount on \\ndamaged books to ensure its everyday low pricing strategy. In contrast, most super\\xad\\nmarkets practice high-low pricing and offer steep discounts on a subset of their prod\\xad\\nuct every week. The Costco pricing strategy results in relatively stable demand. The \\nhigh-low pricing strategy results in a peak during the discount week, often followed by \\na steep drop in demand during the following weeks. The two pricing strategies lead to \\nvery different demand profiles that the supply chain must serve. \\nFixed Price Versus Menu Pricing \\nA firm must decide whether it will charge a fixed price for its supply chain activities or \\nhave a menu with prices that vary with some other attribute, such as the response time \\nor location of delivery. If marginal supply chain costs or the value to the customer vary \\nsignificantly along some attribute, it is often effective to have a pricing menu. We have \\nalready discussed Amazon as an example of a firm offering a menu that is somewhat \\nconsistent with the cost of providing the particular supply chain service. An example \\nwhere the pricing menu is somewhat inconsistent is seen at many MRO suppliers. They \\noften allow customers to have their order shipped to them or to be picked up in per\\xad\\nson. A customer pays an additional shipping fee for home delivery but pays nothing for \\na personal pickup. The pick, pack, and deliver cost at the warehouse, however, is higher \\nin the case of a personal pickup compared to home delivery. The pricing policy thus can \\nlead to customer behavior that has a negative impact on profits. \\nPricing-Related Metrics \\nA manager should track the following pricing-related metrics. With menu pricing, each \\nmetric should be tracked separately for each segment in the menu. \\n• Profit margin measures profit as a percentage of revenue. A firm needs to examine \\na wide variety of profit margin metrics to optimize its pricing, including dimensions'),\n",

In this section we discuss some of the obstacles and also pro\\xad\\nvide a feel for how the supply chain environment has changed over the years. On one \\nhand, these obstacles have made it much more difficult for companies to create the \\nideal balance. On the other hand, they have afforded companies increased opportunities \\nfor improving supply chain management. Managers need a solid understanding of the \\nimpact of these obstacles because they are critical to a company's ability to reap the \\nmaximum profitability from its supply chain. \\nf\"),\n",

With customers demanding ever more cus\\xad\\ntomized products, manufacturers have responded with mass customization and even \\nsegment-of-one (companies view each customer as an independent market segment) \\nviews of the market. Products that were formerly quite generic are now custom-made \\nfor a specific consumer. For example, the number of running shoe styles sold in the United \\nStates went from five in the early 1970s to almost 300 by the late 1990s. The increase in \\nproduct variety complicates the supply chain by making forecasting much more diffi\\xad\\ncult. Increased variety tends to raise uncertainty, and increased uncertainty hurts both \\nefficiency and responsiveness within the supply chain. \\nDECREASING PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES \\nIn addition to the increasing variety of product types, the life cycle of products has \\nbeen shrinking. Today there are products whose life cycles can be measured in \\nmonths, compared to the old standard of years. These are not just niche products, \\neither. PCs now have a life cycle of several months, and even some automobile man\\xad\\nufacturers have lowered their product life cycles from five plus years to about three \\nyears. This decrease in product life cycles makes the job of achieving strategic fit \\nmore difficult, as the supply chain must constantly adapt to manufacture and deliver \\nnew products, in addition to coping with these products' demand uncertainty. Shorter \\nlife cycles increase uncertainty while reducing the window of opportunity within \\nwhich the supply chain can achieve fit. Increased uncertainty combined with a smaller \\nwindow of opportunity has put additional pressure on supply chains to coordinate and \\ncreate a good match between supply and demand. \\nINCREASINGLY DEMANDING CUSTOMERS \\nCustomers are constantly demanding improvements in delivery lead times, cost, and \\nproduct performance. If they do not receive these improvements, they move on to new \\nsuppliers. Many companies had periodic, standard price increases--not due to a rise in \\ndemand or any other factor, but simply because raising prices was the way business was \\ndone. Now, one repeatedly sees companies that cannot force through any price \\nincreases without losing market share. Today's customers are demanding faster fulfill\\xad\\nment, better quality, and better-performing products for the same price they paid years \\nago. This tremendous growth in customer demands (not necessarily demand) means \\nthat the supply chain must provide more just to maintain its business. \\nFRAGMENTATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN OWNERSHIP \\nOver the past several decades, most firms have become less vertically integrated. As \\ncompanies have shed noncore functions, they have been able to take advantage of sup\\xad\\nplier and customer competencies that they themselves did not have. This new owner\\xad\\nship structure, however, has also made managing the supply chain more difficult. With \\nthe chain broken into many owners, each with its own policies and interests, the chain \\nis more difficult to coordinate. Potentially, this problem could cause each stage of a \\nsupply chain to work only toward its own objectives rather than the whole chain's, \\nresulting in the reduction of overall supply chain profitability. \\nGLOBALIZATION \\nSupply chains today are more likely than ever to be global. Establishing a global supply \\nchain creates many benefits, such as the ability to source from a global base of suppliers\"),\n",

Globalization, however, also adds stress to the chain, because facilities within \\nthe chain are farther apart, making coordination much more difficult. \\nGlobalization has also increased competition, as once-protected national players \\nmust compete with companies from around the world. In the past, with fewer compa\\xad\\nnies satisfying customers' needs, customers were willing to tolerate longer response \\ntimes. However, in most industries there are now many more firms aggressively pursu\\xad\\ning their competitors' business. This competitive situation makes supply chain perfor\\xad\\nmance a key to maintaining and growing sales while also putting more strain on supply \\nchains and thus forcing them to choose their trade-offs even more precisely. \\nDIFFICULTY EXECUTING NEW STRATEGIES \\nCreating a successful supply chain strategy is not easy. Once a good strategy is formu\\xad\\nlated, however, the execution of the strategy can be even more difficult. For instance, \\nToyota's production system, which is a supply chain strategy, has been widely known and \\nunderstood. Yet this strategy has been a sustained competitive advantage for Toyota for \\nmore than two decades. Does Toyota have a brilliant strategy that no one else can figure \\nout? Their strategy is brilliant, but many others have figured it out. The difficulty other \\nfirms have had is in executing that strategy. Many highly talented employees at all levels \\nof the organization are necessary to make a supply chain strategy successful. Although \\nwe deal mostly with the formulation of strategy in this book, one should keep in mind \\nthat skillful execution of a strategy can be as important as the strategy itself. \\nAll of the obstacles discussed earlier are making it more difficult for companies to \\nachieve strategic fit in the supply chain. These obstacles also represent a tremendous \\nopportunity in terms of untapped improvement within the supply chain. The increasing \\nimpact of these obstacles has led to supply chain management becoming a major factor \\nin the success or failure of firms. \\nKEY. POINT. Many obstaCles, such as rising product variety and shorter life cycles, \\nhave made itincreasinglydi~icult for supply chains to achi.eve strategic fit Overcoming \\nthese obstacles offers a tremehdous opportunity for firms. to use supply chain manage\\xad\\nment to gain competitive advantage, \\n3.10 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Identify the major drivers of supply chain performance. \\nThe major drivers of supply chain performance are facilities, inventory, transportation, \\ninformation, sourcing, and pricing. \\n2.

Each driver affects this balance. Having more facilities generally makes a \\nchain more responsive, while having fewer, central facilities creates higher efficiency. \\nHolding higher levels of inventory increases the responsiveness of a supply chain, while \\nkeeping inventory low increases the chain's efficiency. Using faster modes of transportation \\nincreases a chain's responsiveness, while using slower modes generally increases efficiency. \\nInvesting in information can vastly improve the supply chain performance on both dimen\\xad\\nsions.

Appropriate sourcing decisions raise supply chain profits by assigning sup\\xad\\nply chain functions to the right party, who brings higher economies of scale or a higher level \\nof aggregation of uncertainty. Pricing can be used to attract the right target customer seg\\xad\\nment. Differential pricing can be used to attract customers who value responsiveness as well \\nas customers who want efficiency. The supply chain can then be structured to provide \\nresponsiveness to some customers while improving overall efficiency. \\n3. Define the key metrics that track the performance of the supply chain in terms of each driver. \\nFacility-related metrics are capacity, utilization, theoretical flow/cycle time of produc\\xad\\ntion, actual flow/cycle time, flow time efficiency, product variety, volume contribution of top \\n20 percent SKUs/customers, processing/setup/down/idle time, and average production batch \\nsize. Inventory-related metrics are average inventory, products with more than a specified \\nnumber of days of inventory, average replenishment batch size, average safety inventory, \\nseasonal inventory, fill rate, and fraction of time out of stock. Transportation-related metrics \\nare average inbound transportation cost, average incoming shipment size, average \\ninbound transportation cost per shipment, average outbound transportation cost, average \\noutbound shipment size, average outbound transportation cost per shipment, and fraction \\ntransported by mode. Information-related metrics are forecast horizon, forecast error, sea\\xad\\nsonal factors, variance from plan, and ratio of demand variability to order variability. \\nSourcing-related metrics are days payable outstanding, average purchase price, range of pur\\xad\\nchase price, average purchase quantity, fraction on-time deliveries, supply quality, and supply \\nlead time. Pricing-related metrics are profit margin, days sales outstanding, incremental \\nfixed cost per order, incremental variable cost per unit, average sale price, average order \\nsize, range of sale price, and range of periodic sales. \\n4.

The company was \\nfirst listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1979. \\nIn 2004 it was owned by the Ito-Yokado group, which also \\nmanaged a chain of supermarkets in Japan and owned a \\nmajority share in Southland, the company managing Seven\\xad\\nEleven in the United States. Seven-Eleven Japan realized a \\nphenomenal growth between the years of 1985 and 2003. \\nDuring that period, the number of stores increased from \\n2,299 to 10,303; annual sales increased from 386 billion to \\n2,343 billion yen; and net income increased from 9 billion to \\n91.5 billion yen. Additionally, the company's return on \\nequity (ROE) averaged around 14 percent between 2000 \\nand 2004. In 2004, Seven-Eleven Japan represented Japan's \\nlargest retailer in terms of operating income and number of \\nstores. Customer visits to Seven-Eleven outlets totaled 3.6 \\nbillion that year, averaging almost 30 visits to a Seven\\xad\\nEleven annually for every person in Japan. \\nCOMPANY HISTORY AND PROFILE \\nBoth Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan were founded \\nby Masatoshi Ito. He started his retail empire after World . \\nWar II, when he joined his mother and elder brother and \\nbegan to work in a small clothing store in Tokyo. By 1960 \\nhe was in sole control, and the single store had grown into \\na $3 million company. After a trip to the United States in \\n1961, Ito became convinced that superstores were the \\nwave of the future. At that time, Japan was still domi\\xad\\nnated by Mom-and-Pop stores. Ito's chain of superstores \\nin the Tokyo area was instantly popular and soon consti\\xad\\ntuted the core of Ito-Yokado's retail operations. \\nIn 1972, Ito first approached the Southland \\nCorporation about the possibility of opening Seven-Eleven \\nconvenience stores in Japan. After rejecting his initial \\nrequest, Southland agreed in 1973 to a licensing agreement. \\nIn exchange for 0.6 percent of total sales, Southland gave \\nIto exclusive rights throughout Japan. In May 1974, the first \\nSeven-Eleven convenience store opened in Tokyo. \\nThis new concept was an immediate hit in Japan, and \\nSeven-Eleven Japan experienced tremendous growth. By \\n1979 there were already 591 Seven-Eleven stores in \\nJapan; by 1984 there were 2,001. Rapid growth continued \\n(see Table 3-1), resulting in 10,356 stores by 2004. \\nOn October 24, 1990, the Southland Corporation \\nentered into bankruptcy protection. Southland asked for \\nIto-Yokado's help, and on March 5, 1991, IYG Holding \\nwas formed by Seven-Eleven Japan (48 percent) and Ito\\xad\\nYokado (52 percent). IYG acquired 70 percent of South\\xad\\nland's common stock for a total price of $430 million. \\nIn 2004, convenience store operations from Seven\\xad\\nEleven Japan and 7-Eleven Inc. in the United States con\\xad\\ntributed 48.2 percent of total revenues and 90.2 percent \\nof total consolidated operating income for the Ito Yokado \\ngroup.

From 1991 to 2002 the number of \\nstores in Japan increased from 19,603 to \\n42,000. As a percentage of all retail stores in Japan, \\n:..r.resented an increase from 1.2 percent to 3.2 per\\xad\\nthat period, annual sales at convenience \\nmore than doubled, from just over 3 trillion to 6.7 \\nyen. As a percentage of all retail sales in Japan, this \\n·esented an increase from 2.2 percent to 5.0 percent. \\nconvenience store sector gradually consoli\\xad\\nwith larger players growing and smaller operators \\ndown. In 2004, the top 10 convenience store \\naccounted for approximately 90 percent of Japan\\'s \\n:Oiwenience stores. As the chains improved their operat\\xad\\nstructures and better leveraged economies of scale, \\noperators found it hard to compete. \\nSeven-Eleven Japan had increased its share of the \\n~convenience store market since it opened. In 2002, Seven\\xad\\nwas Japan\\'s leading convenience store operator, \\naccounting for 21.7 percent of all convenience stores and \\n31.5 percent of total sales. Seven-Eleven was very effec\\xad\\ntive in terms of same-store sales. In 2004 average daily \\nsales at the four major convenience store chains excluding \\nSeven-Eleven Japan totaled 484,000 yen. Seven-Eleven \\nstores, in contrast, had daily sales of 647,000 yen-more \\nthan 30 percent higher than the competition put together. \\nIn 2004, Seven-Eleven\\'s operating income of 165.7 billion \\nyen positioned it as a leader not only of the convenience \\nstore sector but also of Japan\\'s retail industry as a whole. \\nIn terms of growth, its performance was even more \\nimpressive. In 2004 Seven-Eleven accounted for 60 per\\xad\\ncent of the total net increase in the number of stores \\namong the top 10 convenience store chains in Japan. This \\ngrowth had been very carefully planned, exploiting the \\ncore strengths that Seven-Eleven Japan had developed in \\nthe areas of information systems and distribution systems. \\nTHE SEVEN-ELEVEN JAPAN \\nFRANCHISE SYSTEM \\nSeven-Eleven Japan developed an extensive franchise \\nnetwork and performed a key role in the daily operations \\nof this network. The Seven-Eleven Japan network \\nincluded both company-owned stores and thirdcparty\\xad\\nowned franchises. In 2004, franchise commissions \\naccounted for over 68 percent of revenue from opera\\xad\\ntions. To ensure efficiency, Seven-Eleven Japan based its \\nfundamental network expansion policy on a market\\xad\\ndominance strategy. Entry into any new market was built \\naround a cluster of 50 to 60 stores supported by a distri\\xad\\nbution center. Such clustering gave Seven-Eleven Japan a \\nhigh-density market presence and allowed it to operate \\nan efficient distribution system. Seven-Eleven Japan, in \\nits 1994 annual report, listed the following six advantages \\nof the market-dominance strategy: \\n• Boosted distribution efficiency \\n• Improved brand awareness \\n• Increased system efficiency \\n• Enhanced efficiency of franchise support services \\n• Improved advertising effectiveness \\n• Prevented competitors\\' entrance into the dominant \\narea \\nAdhering to its dominant strategy, Seven-Eleven \\nJapan opened the majority of its new stores in areas with \\nexisting clusters of stores. For example, the Aichi prefec\\xad\\nture, where Seven-Eleven began opening stores in 2002, \\nsaw a large increase in 2004, with 108 new store openings. \\nThis represented more than 15 percent of the new Seven\\xad\\nEleven stores opened in Japan that year. \\nGeographically, Seven-Eleven has a limited presence \\nin Japan. In 2004 the company had stores in about 70 per\\xad\\ncent (32 of 47) of the prefectures within Japan. However, \\nwithin prefectures where they were present, stores \\ntended to be dense. As the 2004 annual report stated, \\n\"Filling in the entire map of Japan is not our priority. \\nInstead, we look for demand where Seven-Eleven stores \\nalready exist, based on our fundamental area-dominance \\nstrategy of concentrating stores in specific areas.\" \\nWith Seven-Eleven franchises being highly sought \\nafter, fewer than one of 100 applicants were awarded a \\nfranchise (a testament to store profitability). The fran\\xad\\nchise owner was required to put a significant amount of \\nmoney up front. Half of this amount was used to prepare \\nthe store and train the owner. The rest was used for pur\\xad\\nchasing the initial stock for the store. In 1994, 45 percent \\nof total gross profits at a store went to Seven-Eleven \\nJapan, and the rest went to the store owner. The responsi\\xad\\nbilities of the two parties were as follows. \\nSeven-Eleven Japan responsibilities: \\n• Develop supply and merchandise \\n• Provide the ordering system \\n• Pay for the system operation \\n• Supply accounting services \\n• Provide advertising \\n• Install and remodel facilities \\n• Pay 80 percent of utility costs \\nFranchise owner responsibilities: \\n• Operate and manage store \\n• Hire and pay staff \\n• Order supplies \\n• Maintain store appearance \\n• Provide customer service'),\n",

Each store car\\xad\\nried on average about 3,000 SKUs depending on local \\ncustomer demand. Seven-Eleven emphasized regional \\nmerchandizing to cater precisely to local preferences. \\nEach store carried food items, beverages, magazines, and \\nconsumer items such as soaps and detergents. Sales \\nacross product categories from 2002 to 2004 are given in \\nTable 3-3. \\nThe food items were classified in four broad cate\\xad\\ngories: (1) chilled-temperature items including sandwiches, \\ndelicatessen products, and milk; (2) warm-temperature \\nitems including box lunches, rice balls, and fresh bread; \\n(3) frozen items including ice cream, frozen foods, and ice \\ncubes; (4) and room-temperature items including canned \\nfood, instant noodles, and seasonings. Processed food and \\nfast-food items were big sellers for the stores. In 2004, \\nprocessed and fast foods contributed about 60 percent of \\nthe total sales at each store. Over 1 billion rice balls were \\nsold in 2004; this amounted to .each Japanese citizen eat\\xad\\ning approximately eight Seven-Eleven rice balls a year. \\nThe top-selling products in the fast-food category were \\nlunch boxes, rice balls, bread-based products, and pasta. \\nAs of February 2004, Seven-Eleven Japan had 290 dedi\\xad\\ncated manufacturing plants that produced only fast food \\nfor their stores. \\nOther products sold at Seven-Eleven stores included \\nsoft drinks, nutritional drinks, alcoholic beverages \\nsuch as beer and wine, game software, music CDs, and \\nmagazines. \\nIn 2004, Seven-Eleven was focused on increasing the \\nnumber of original items that were available only at their \\nstores. At that time, original items accounted for roughly \\n52 percent of total store sales. The company aimed to \\nincrease the percentage to 60 percent in the medium to \\nlong term. \\n2001 2002 2003 2004 \\n2,046.6 2,114.0 2,213.3 2,343.2 \\n346.9 365.9 400.7 445.4 \\n147.2 153.8 \\n159.6 168.9 \\n78.4 83.2 86.5 91.5 \\n8,602 9,060 9,690 10,303 \\nSTORE SERVICES \\nBesides products, Seven-Eleven Japan gradually added a \\nvariety of services that customers could obtain at its \\nstores. The first service, added in October 1987, was the \\nin-store payment of Tokyo Electric Power bills. The com\\xad\\npany later expanded the set of utilities for which cus\\xad\\ntomers could pay their bills in the stores to include gas, \\ninsurance premiums, and telephone. With more conve\\xad\\nnient operating hours and locations than banks or other \\nfinancial institutions, the bill payment service attracted \\nmillions of additional customers every year. In April \\n1994, Seven-Eleven Japan began accepting installment \\npayments on behalf of credit companies. It started selling \\nski-lift pass vouchers in November 1994. In 1995 it began \\nto accept payment for mail-order purchases. This was \\nexpanded to include payment for Internet shopping in \\nNovember 1999. In August 2000, a meal delivery service \\ncompany, Seven-Meal Service Co. Ltd., was established to \\nserve the aging Japanese population. In 2001, IYBank Co. \\nwas established through a joint investment with Ito \\nYokado. By April2004,ATMs had been installed in about \\n75 percent of the total store network in Japan, with the \\ngoal to achieve 100 percent ATM installation. \\nOther services offered at stores include photocopy\\xad\\ning, ticket sales using multifunctional copiers, and being a \\npick-up location for parcel delivery companies that typi\\xad\\ncally do not leave the parcel outside if the customer is not \\nat home. The major thrust for offering these services was to \\nmake Seven-Eleven stores in Japan more convenient places \\nto shop. Several of these services exploited the existing \\nTotal Information System (see text following) in the store. \\nIn February 2000, Seven-Eleven Japan established \\n7dream.com, an e-commerce company. The goal was to \\nexploit the existing distribution system and the fact that \\nstores were easily accessible to most Japanese. Stores \\nserved as drop-off and collection points for Japanese \\ncustomers. A survey by eSBook (a joint venture among \\nSoftbank, Seven-Eleven Japan, Yahoo!Japan, and \\nTohan, a publisher) discovered that 92 percent of its cus\\xad\\ntomers preferred to pick up their online purchases at \\nthe local convenience store, rather than have them \\ndelivered to their homes. This was understandable given \\nthe frequency with which Japanese customers visit their \\nlocal convenience store. 7dream hoped to build on this \\nf t'),\n",

The first online net\\xad\\nwork linking the head office, stores, and vendors was \\nestablished in 1979, though the company did not collect \\npoint-of-sales (POS) information at that time. In 1982, \\nSeven-Eleven became the first company in Japan to \\nintroduce a POS system comprising POS cash registers \\nand terminal control equipment. In 1985 the company \\ndeveloped, jointly with NEC, personal computers using \\ncolor graphics that were installed at each store and linked \\nto the POS cash registers. These computers were also on \\nthe network linking the store to the head office as well \\nas the vendors. Until July 1991, head office, stores, dis\\xad\\ntribution centers, and suppliers were linked only by a \\ntraditional analog network. At that time, an integrated \\nservices digital network (ISDN) was installed. Linking \\nmore than 5,000 stores, it became one of the world's \\nlargest ISDN systems at that time. \\nThe two-way, high-speed, online communication \\ncapability of ISDN enabled Seven-Eleven Japan to col\\xad\\nlect, process, and feed back POS data quickly. Sales data \\ngathered in each store by 11:00 P.M. were processed and \\nready for analysis the next morning. In 1997, Seven\\xad\\nEleven Japan introduced its fifth generation of the Total \\nInformation System, which was still in use in 2004. \\nThe hardware system at a 1994 Seven-Eleven store \\nincluded the following: \\n• Graphic order terminal: This was a hand-held \\ndevice with a wide-screen graphic display, used by \\nthe store owner or manager to place orders. The \\nitems were recorded and brought up in the order in \\nwhich they were arranged on the shelves. The store \\nmanager/owner walked down the aisles and placed \\norders by item. When placing an order, the store \\nmanager had access (from the store computer) to \\ndetailed analysis of POS data related to the particu\\xad\\nlar item. This included sales analysis of product cate\\xad\\ngories and SKUs over time, analysis of waste, 10-week \\nsales trends by SKU, 10-day sales trends by SKU, \\nsales trends for new products, sales analysis by day \\nand time, list of slow-moving items, analysis of sales \\nand number of customers over time, contribution of \\nproduct to sections in store display, and sales growth \\nby product categories. The store manager used this \\ninformation when placing his order, which was \\nentered directly into the terminal. Once all the \\norders were placed, the terminal was returned to its \\nslot, at which point the orders were relayed by the \\nstore computer to both the appropriate vendor and \\nthe Seven-Eleven distribution center. \\n• Scanner terminal: These scanners read bar codes \\nand recorded inventory. They were used to receive \\nproducts coming in from a distribution center. This \\nwas automatically checked against a previously \\nplaced order, and the two were reconciled. Before \\nthe scanner terminals were introduced, truck drivers \\nwaited in the store until the delivery was checked. \\nOnce they were introduced, the driver simply \\ndropped the delivery in the store, and a store clerk \\nreceived it at a suitable time when there were few \\ncustomers. The scanner terminals were also used \\nwhen examining inventory at stores. \\n• Store computer: This linked to the ISDN network, \\nthe POS register, the graphic order terminal, and \\nthe scanner terminal. It communicated among the \\nvarious input sources, tracked store inventory and \\nsales, placed orders, provided detailed analysis of \\nPOS data, and maintained and regulated store \\nequipment. \\n• POS register: To better understand the functioning \\nof this information network, one needs to consider a \\nsampling of daily operations. As soon as a customer \\npurchased an item and paid at the POS register, the \\nitem information was retrieved from the store \\ncomputer and the time of sale was automatically \\nrecorded. In addition, the cashier recorded the age \\nand sex of the customer. To do this, the cashier used \\nfive register keys for the categories: under-13, 13-19, \\n20-29,30-49, and 50+. This POS data was automati\\xad\\ncally transmitted online to a host computer. All \\nsales data collected by 11:00 P.M. were organized \\nand ready for analysis by the next morning. The \\ndata were evaluated on a company-wide, district, \\nand store basis. \\nThe analyzed and updated data were then sent back \\nto the Seven-Eleven Japan stores via the network. Each \\nstore computer automatically updated its product master \\nfile to analyze its recent sales and stock movements. The \\nmain objective of the analysis was to improve the order\\xad\\ning process. All this information was available on the \\ngraphic order terminal used for order placement. \\nThe information system allowed Seven-Eleven \\nstores to better match supply with demand. Store staff \\ncould adjust the merchandising mix on the shelves \\naccording to consumption patterns throughout the day. \\nFor example, popular breakfast items were stocked ear\\xad\\nlier during the day, while popular dinner items were \\nstocked later in the evening. The identification of slow \\nand nonmoving items allowed a store to convert shelf \\nspace to introduce new items. More than 50 percent of \\nthe items sold at a Seven-Eleven store changed in the \\n··-·-~·-----·--· -----~----.. -·---------------~ \\n., \\n)\"),\n",

This was due partly to seasonal demand \\nand partly to new products. When a new product was \\nintroduced, the decision whether to continue stocking it \\nwas made within the first three weeks. Each item on the \\nshelf contributed to sales and margin and did not waste \\nvaluable shelf space. \\nSEVEN-ELEVEN'S DISTRIBUTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Seven-Eleven distribution system tightly linked the \\nentire supply chain for all product categories. The Seven\\xad\\nEleven distribution centers and the information network \\nplayed a key role in that regard. The major objective was \\nto carefully track sales of items and offer short replenish\\xad\\nment cycle times. This allowed a store manager to fore\\xad\\ncast sales corresponding to each order accurately. \\nFrom March 1987, Seven-Eleven, offered three\\xad\\ntimes-a-day store delivery of all rice dishes (which com\\xad\\nprised most of the fast-food items sold). Bread and other \\nfresh food were delivered twice a day. The distribution \\nsystem was flexible enough to alter delivery schedules \\ndepending on customer demand. For example, ice cream \\nwas delivered daily during the summer but only three \\ntimes a week at other times. The replenishment cycle time \\nfor fresh and fast-food items had been shortened to less \\nthan 12 hours. A store order for rice balls by 10:00 A.M. \\nwas delivered before the dinner rush. \\nAs discussed earlier, the store manager used a \\ngraphic order terminal to place an order. All stores were \\ngiven cutoff times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner order\\xad\\ning. When a store placed an order, it was immediately \\ntransmitted to the supplier as well as the distribution cen\\xad\\nter. The supplier received orders from all Seven-Eleven \\nstores and started production to fill the orders. The sup\\xad\\nplier then sent the orders by truck to the distribution cen\\xad\\nter. Each store order was separated so the distribution \\ncenter could easily assign it to the appropriate store truck \\nusing the order information it already had. The key to \\nstore delivery was what Seven-Eleven called the com\\xad\\nbined delivery system. At the distribution center, delivery \\nof like products from different suppliers (for example, milk \\nand sandwiches) was directed into a single temperature\\xad\\ncontrolled truck. There were four categories of tempera\\xad\\nture-controlled trucks: frozen foods, chilled foods, room\\xad\\ntemperature processed foods, and warm foods. Each \\ntruck made deliveries to multiple retail stores. The num\\xad\\nber of stores per truck depended on the sales volume. All \\ndeliveries were made during off-peak hours and were \\nreceived using the scanner terminals. The system worked \\non trust and did not require the delivery person to be pre\\xad\\nsent when the store personnel scanned in the delivery. \\nThat reduced the delivery time spent at each store. \\nThis distribution system enabled Seven-Eleven to \\nreduce the number of vehicles required for daily delivery \\nservice to each store, even though the delivery frequency \\nof each item was quite high. In 1974, 70 vehicles visited \\neach store every day. In 1994, only 11 were necessary. This \\ndramatically reduced delivery costs and enabled rapid \\ndeliver of a variety of fresh foods. · \\nAs of February 2004, Seven-Eleven Japan had a total \\nof 290 dedicated manufacturing plants throughout the \\ncountry that produced only fast food for Seven-Eleven \\nstores. These items were distributed through 293 dedi\\xad\\ncated distribution centers (DCs) that ensured rapid, reli\\xad\\nable delivery. None of these DCs carried any inventory; \\nthey merely transferred inventory from supplier trucks to \\nSeven-Eleven distribution trucks. The transportation was \\nprovided by Transfleet Ltd., a company set up by Mitsui \\nand Co. for the exclusive use of Seven-Eleven Japan. \\n7-ELEVEN IN THE UNITED STATES \\nSeven-Eleven had expanded rapidly around the world \\n(see Table 3-4). The major growth was in Asia, though the \\nUnited States continued to be the second largest market \\nfor Seven-Eleven. Once Seven-Eleven Japan acquired \\nSouthland Corporation, it set about improving opera\\xad\\ntions in the United States. In the initial years, several \\n7-Eleven stores in the United States were shut down. The \\nnumber of stores started to grow beginning in 1998. \\nHistorically, the distribution structure in the United \\nStates was completely different from that of Japan.

DSD accounted \\nfor about half the total volume, with the rest coming from \\nwholesalers. \\nWith the goal of introducing \"fresh\" products, \\n7-Eleven introduced the concept of combined distribu\\xad\\ntion centers (CDCs) around 2000. By 2003, 7-Eleven had \\n23 CDCs located throughout North America supporting \\nabout 80 percent of the store network. CDCs delivered \\nfresh items such as sandwiches, bakery products, bread, \\nproduce, and other perishables once a day. A variety of \\nfresh-food suppliers sent product to the CDC throughout \\nthe day, where they were sorted for delivery to stores at \\nnight. Requests from store managers were sent to the \\nnearest CDC, and by 10:00 P.M. the products were en \\nroute to the stores. Fresh-food sales in North America \\nexceeded $450 million in 2003. During this period, DSD \\nby manufacturers and wholesaler delivery to stores also. \\ncontinued. \\nThis was a period when 7-Eleven worked very hard \\nto introduce new fresh-food items with a goal of compet\\xad\\ning more directly with the likes of Starbucks than with \\ntraditional gas station food marts. 7-Eleven in the United \\nStates had over 68 percent of its sales from nongasoline \\nproducts compared to the rest of the industry, for which \\nthis number was closer to 35 percent. The goal was to \\ncontinue to increase sales in the fresh-food and fast-food \\ncategories. \\nIn 2003 revenue in the United States and Canada \\ntotaled $10.9 billion, with about 69 percent coming from \\nmerchandise and the rest from the sale of gasoline. The \\nNorth American inventory turnover rate in 2004 was \\nabout 19, compared to over 50 in Japan. This perfor\\xad\\nmance, however, represented a significant improvement \\nin North American performance, where inventory turns \\nin 1992 were around 12. \\nSTUDY QUESTIONS \\n1.

Identify the key factors to be considered when designing a distribution network. \\n2. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various distribution options. \\n3. Understand how e-business has affected the design of distribution networks in different \\nindustries. \\nI\\nn this chapter, we provide an understanding of the role of distribution within a \\nsupply chain and identify factors that should be considered when designing a dis\\xad\\ntribution network. We identify several potential designs for distribution networks \\nand evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each option. We apply these ideas to dis\\xad\\ncuss the evolution of distribution networks in various industries since the advent of \\ne-business. Our goal is to provide managers with a logical framework for selecting the \\nappropriate distribution network given product, competitive, and market characteristics. \\n4.1 THE ROLE OF DISTRIBUTION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nDistribution refers to the steps taken to move and store a product from the supplier \\nstage to a customer stage in the supply chain. Distribution occurs between every pair of \\nstages in the supply chain. Raw materials and components are moved from suppliers to \\nmanufacturers, whereas finished products are moved from the manufacturer to the end \\nconsumer. Distribution is a key driver of the overall profitability of a firm because it \\naffects both the supply chain cost and the customer experience directly. Distribution\\xad\\nrelated costs make up about 10.5 P.~t of the U.S. economy and abo~ut20 per~nt of .~ \\nthe cost of manufacturing. For ~llliil.04i,tY products, distribution forms an even highe; \\nfraction of the product cost. In India, the outbound distribution cost of cement is about \\n30 percent of the cost of producing and selling cement. \\nIt would be no exaggeration to state that two of the world\\'s most profitable com\\xad\\npanies, Wal-Mart and Seven-Eleven Japan, have built the success of their entire busi\\xad\\nness around outstanding distribution design and operation. In the case of Wal-Mart, \\ndistribution allows the company to provide high availability levels of relatively com\\xad\\nmon products at a very low cost.

Gateway opened Gateway \\nCountry stores, where customers could examine the products and have salespeople \\nhelp them configure a PC that suited their needs. Gateway, however, chose to sell no \\nproducts at the stores; all PCs were shipped directly from the factory to the customer. \\nIn 2001, Gateway closed several of these stores because of their poor financial perfor\\xad\\nmance. Apple Computer, in contrast, has opened many retail stores where computers \\nare sold. These PC companies have chosen different distribution models. How can we \\nevaluate this wide range of distribution choices? Which ones serve the companies and \\ntheir customers better? \\nP&G has chosen to distribute directly to large supermarket chains while obligating \\nsmaller players to buy P&G products from distributors. Products move directly from \\nP&G to the larger chains, but move through an additional stage when going to smaller \\nsupermarkets. Texas Instruments, which once used only direct sales, now sells about 30 \\npercent of its volume to 98 percent of its customers through distributors, while serving \\nthe remaining 2 percent of customers with 70 percent of the voiume directly.1 What \\nvalue do these distributors provide? When should a distribution network include an \\nadditional stage such as a distributor? Proponents of e-business had predicted the death \\nof intermediaries such as distributors.

The remaining, slower-moving products are not stocked but \\ninstead are shipped directly from the manufacturer when a customer places an order. It \\ntakes several days for the customer to receive the product in this case. Are these distri\\xad\\nbution choices appropriate? How can they be justified? \\nAs the preceding examples illustrate, firms can make many different choices when \\ndesigning their distribution network. A poor distribution network can hurt the level of \\nservice that customers receive while increasing the cost. An inappropriate network can \\nhave a significant negative effect on the profitability of the firm, as evident in the fail\\xad\\nure of many business-to-consumer (B2C) companies such as Webvan.

The customer needs that are met influence the com\\xad\\npany's revenues, which along with cost decide the profitability of the delivery network. \\nAlthough customer service consists of many components, we focus on those mea-\\nsures that are influenced by the structure of the distribution network. These include: \\n• Response time \\n• Product variety \\n•· Product availability \\n• Customer experience \\n• Time to market \\n• Order visibility \\n• Returnability \\nResponse time is the amount of time it takes for a customer to receive an order. \\nProduct variety is the number of different products/configurations that are offered by \\nthe distribution network. Product availability is the probability of having a product in \\nstock when a customer order arrives. Customer experience includes the ease with \\nwhich customers can place and receive orders as well as the extent to which this expe\\xad\\nrience is customized. It also includes purely experiential aspects, such as the possibility \\nof getting a cup of coffee and the value that the sales staff provides. Time to market is \\nthe time it takes to bring a new product to the market. Order visibility is the ability of \\ncustomers to track their orders from placement to delivery. Returnability is the ease \\nwith which a customer can return unsatisfactory merchandise and the ability of the \\nnetwork to handle such returns. \\nIt may seem at first that a customer always wants the highest level of performance \\nalong all these dimensions. In practice, however, this is not the case. Customers order\\xad\\ning a book at Amazon.com are willing to wait longer than those who drive to a nearby \\nBorders store to get the same book. In contrast, customers can find a much larger vari\\xad\\nety of books at Amazon compared to the Borders store. Thus,Amazon customers trade \\noff fast response times for high levels of variety. \\nFirms that target customers who can tolerate a long response time require only a \\nfew locations that may be far from the customer. These companies can focus on increas\\xad\\ning the capacity of each location. In contrast, firms that target customers who value \\nshort response times need to locate facilities close to them. These firms must have many \\nfacilities, each with a low capacity. Thus, a decrease in the response time customers \\ndesire increases the number of facilities required in the network, as shown in Figure 4-1. \\nRequired \\nNumber \\nof Facilities \\nDesired \\n~...-____________ _..Response \\nTime\"),\n",

Will product flow through an intermediary (or intermediate location)? \\nBased on the firm's industry and the answers to these two questions, one of six dis\\xad\\ntinct distribution network designs may be used to move products from factory to cus\\xad\\ntomer, which are classified as follows: \\n1.

Distributor storage with last-mile delivery \\n5. Manufacturer/distributor storage with costumer pickup \\n6. Retail storage with customer pickup \\nNext we describe each distribution option and discuss its strengths and \\nweaknesses. \\nMANUFACTURER STORAGE WITH DIRECT SHIPPING \\nIn this option, product is shipped directly from the manufacturer to the end customer, \\nbypassing the retailer (who takes the order and initiates the delivery request). This \\noption is also referred to as drop-shipping, with product delivered directly from the man\\xad\\nufacturer to the customer. The retailer, if independent of the manufacturer, carries no \\ninventories. Information flows from the customer, via the retailer, to the manufacturer, \\nand product is shipped directly from the manufacturer to customers as shown in \\nFigure 4-6. Online retailers such as eBags and Nordstrom.com use drop-shipping to \\ndeliver goods to the end consumer. eBags holds few bags in inventory. Nordstrom carries \\nsome products in inventory and uses the drop-ship model for slow-moving footwear. \\nW.W. Grainger also uses drop-shipping to deliver slow-moving items to customers. \\nThe biggest advantage of drop-shipping is the ability to centralize inventories at the \\nmanufacturer. A manufacturer can aggregate demand across all retailers that it supplies. \\nAs a result, the supply chain is able to provide a high level of product availability with \\nlower levels of inventory. A key issue with regard to drop-shipping is the ownership \\nstructure of the inventory at the manufacturer. If specified portions of inventory at the \\nmanufacturer are allocated to individual retailers, there is little benefit of aggregation \\neven though the inventory is physically aggregated. Benefit of aggregation is achieved \\nonly if the manufacturer can allocate at least a portion of the available inventory across \\nretailers on an as-needed basis. The benefits from centralization are highest for high\\xad\\nvalue, low-demand items with unpredictable demand. The decision of Nordstrom to \\ndrop-ship low-demand shoes satisfies these criteria. Similarly, bags sold by eBags tend \\nto have high value and relatively low demand per SKU. The inventory benefits of aggre\\xad\\ngation are small for items with predictable demand and low value. Thus, drop-shipping \\ndoes not offer a significant inventory advantage to an online grocer selling a staple item \\nsuch as detergent. For slow-moving items, inventory turns can increase by a factor of 6 \\nor higher if drop-shipping is used instead of storage at retail stores. \\nDrop-shipping also offers the manufacturer the opportunity to postpone cus\\xad\\ntomization until after a customer has placed an order.

Build-to-order com\\xad\\npanies such as Dell hold inventories as common components and postpone product \\ncustomization, thus lowering the level of inventory carried. \\nAlthough inventory costs are typically low with drop-shipping, transportation \\ncosts are high because the average outbound distance to the end consumer is large, and \\npackage carriers are used to ship the product. Package carriers have high shipping \\ncosts per unit compared to truckload or less-than-truckload carriers. With drop\\xad\\nshipping, a customer order including items from several manufacturers will involve \\nmultiple shipments to the customer. This loss in aggregation of outbound transporta\\xad\\ntion increases cost. \\nSupply chains save on the fixed cost of facilities when using drop-shipping because \\nall inventories are centralized at the manufacturer. This eliminates the need for other \\nwarehousing space in the supply chain. There can be some savings of handling costs as \\nwell, because the transfer from manufacturer to retailer no longer occurs. Handling \\ncost savings must be evaluated carefully, however, because the manufacturer is now \\nrequired to transfer items to the factory warehouse in full cases and then ship out from \\nthe warehouse in single units. The inability of a manufacturer to develop single-unit \\ndelivery capabilities can have a significant negative effect on handling cost and \\nresponse time. Handling costs can be reduced significantly if the manufacturer has the \\ncapability to ship orders directly from the production line. \\nA good information infrastructure is needed between the retailers and the manu\\xad\\nfacturer so that the retailer can provide product availability information to the cus\\xad\\ntomer, even though the inventory is located at the manufacturer. The customer should \\nalso have visibility into order processing at the manufacturer, even with the order \\nbeing placed with the retailer. Drop-shipping generally requires significant investment \\nin information infrastructure. The information infrastructure requirement is somewhat \\nsimpler for direct sellers like Dell because two stages (retailer and manufacturer) do \\nnot need to be integrated. \\nResponse times tend to be long when drop-shipping is used because the order has \\nto be transmitted from the retailer to the manufacturer and shipping distances are \\ngenerally longer from the manufacturer's centralized site. eBags, for example, states \\nthat order processing may take from one to five days and ground transportation after \\nthat may take from three to 11 business days. This implies that customer response time \\nat eBags will be four to 16 days using ground transportation and drop-shipping. \\nAnother issue is that the response time need not be identical for every manufac\\xad\\nturer that is part of a customer order. Given an order containing products from several \\nsources, the customer will receive multiple partial shipments over time, making receiv\\xad\\ning more complicated for the customer. \\nManufacturer storage allows a high level of product variety to be available to the \\ncustomer. With a drop-shipping model, every product at the manufacturer can be made \\navailable to the customer without any limits imposed by shelf space. W.W. Grainger is \\nable to offer hundreds of thousands of slow-moving items from thousands of manufac\\xad\\nturers using drop-shipping. This would be impossible if each product had to be stored \\nby W.W. Grainger. Drop-shipping allows a new product to be available to the market \\nthe day the first unit is produced. \\nDrop-shipping provides a good customer experience in the form of delivery to the \\ncustomer location. The experience, however, suffers when a single order containing \\nproducts from several manufacturers is delivered in partial shipments. \\nOrder visibility is very important in the context of manufacturer storage, because \\ntwo stages in the supply chain are involved in every customer order. Failure to provide \\nthis capability is likely to have a significant negative effect on customer satisfaction.\"),\n",

For direct sellers such as Dell, order visibility is simpler to provide. \\nA manufacturer storage network is likely to have difficulty handling returns, hurting \\ncustomer satisfaction. The handling of returns is more expensive under drop-shipping \\nbecause each order may involve shipments from more than one manufacturer. There are \\ntwo ways that returns can be handled. One is for the customer to return the product \\ndirectly to the manufacturer. The second approach is for the retailer to set up a separate \\nfacility (across all manufacturers) to handle returns. The first approach incurs high trans\\xad\\nportation and coordination costs, whereas the second approach requires investment in a \\nfacility to handle returns. \\nThe performance characteristics of drop-shipping along various dimensions are \\nsummarized in Table 4-1. \\nGiven its performance characteristics, manufacturer storage with direct shipping is \\nbest suited for a large variety of low-demand, high-value items for which customers are \\nwilling to wait for delivery and accept several partial shipments. Manufacturer storage is \\nalso suitable if it allows the manufacturer to postpone customization, thus reducing \\ninventories. For drop-shipping to be effective, there should be few sourcing locations \\nper order. It is thus ideal for direct sellers that are able to build-to-order.

Information and \\nproduct flows for the in-transit merge network are as shown in Figure 4-7. In-transit \\nmerge has been used by direct sellers such as Dell and can be used by companies \\nimplementing drop-shipping. When a customer orders a PC from Dell along with a \\nSony monitor, the package carrier picks up the PC from the Dell factory and the mon\\xad\\nitor from the Sony factory; it then merges the two together at a hub before making a \\nsingle delivery to the customer. \\nAs with drop-shipping, the ability to aggregate inventories and postpone product \\ncustomization is a significant advantage of in-transit merge. In-transit merge allows \\nDell and Sony to hold all their inventories at the factory. This approach has the great\\xad\\nest benefits for products with high value whose demand is difficult to forecast, particu\\xad\\nlarly if product customization can be postponed. \\nIn most cases, transportation costs are lower than with drop-shipping because of \\nthe merge that takes place at the carrier hub before delivery to the customer, although \\nan increase in coordination is required. An order with products from three manufac\\xad\\nturers thus requires only one delivery to the customer, compared to three that would \\nbe required with drop-shipping. Fewer deliveries save transportation cost and simplify \\nreceiving. \\nFacility and processing costs for the manufacturer and the retailer are similar to \\nthose for drop-shipping. The party performing the in-transit merge has higher facility \\ncosts because of the merge capability required. Receiving costs at the customer are \\nlower because a single delivery is received. Overall supply chain facility and handling \\ncosts are somewhat higher than with drop-shipping. \\nA very sophisticated information infrastructure is needed to allow in-transit \\nmerge. In addition to information, operations at the retailer, manufacturers, and the \\ncarrier must be coordinated. The investment in information infrastructure is higher \\nthan for drop-shipping. \\nResponse times, product variety, availability, and time to market are similar to \\ndrop-shipping.

Order visibility is a very important requirement. Although the initial setup \\nis difficult because it requires integration of manufacturer, carrier, and retailer, track\\xad\\ning itself becomes easier given the merge that occurs at the carrier hub. Up to the point \\nof merge, the order from each manufacturer is tracked separately. After that, the order \\ncan be tracked as a single unit. \\nReturnability is similar to that with drop-shipping. Problems in handling returns \\nare very likely, and the reverse supply chain will continue to be expensive and difficult \\nto implement, as with drop-shipping. \\nThe performance of factory storage with in-transit merge is compared with that \\nof drop-shipping in Table 4-2. The main advantages of in-transit merge over drop\\xad\\nshipping are lower transportation cost and improved customer experience. \\nThe major disadvantage is the additional effort during the merge itself. Given its \\nperformance characteristics, manufacturer storage with in-transit merge is best \\nsuited for low-to medium-demand, high-value items the retailer is sourcing from a \\nlimited number of manufacturers. Compared to drop-shipping, in-transit merge \\nrequires a higher demand from each manufacturer (not necessarily each product) \\nin order to be effective. When there are too many sources, in-transit merge can be \\nvery difficult to coordinate and implement. In-transit merge is best implemented if \\nthere are no more than four or five sourcing locations. The in-transit merge of a \\nDell PC with a Sony monitor is appropriate because product variety is high but \\nthere are few sourcing locations with relatively large total demand from each \\nsourcing location. \\nDISTRIBUTOR STORAGE WITH CARRIER DELIVERY \\nUnder this option, inventory is not held by manufacturers at the factories but is held by \\ndistributors/retailers in intermediate warehouses, and package carriers are used to \\ntransport products from the intermediate location to the final customer. Amazon, as \\nwell as industr1al distributors such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr, have used \\nthis approach combined with drop-shipping from a manufacturer (or distributor). \\nInformation and product flows when using distributor storage with delivery by a pack\\xad\\nage carrier are shown in Figure 4-8.'),\n",

Information Flow \\nRelative to manufacturer storage, distributor storage requires a higher level of \\ninventory, as the distributor/retailer warehouse generally aggregates demand uncer\\xad\\ntainty at a lower level than the manufacturer that is able to aggregate demand across \\nall distributors/retailers. From an inventory perspective, distributor storage makes \\nsense for products with somewhat higher demand. This is seen in the operations of \\nboth Amazon and W.W. Grainger. They stock only the medium-to fast-moving items \\nat their warehouses, with slower-moving items stocked farther upstream. In some \\ninstances, postponement can be implemented with distributor storage, but it does \\nrequire that the warehouse develop some assembly capability. Distributor storage, \\nhowever, requires much less inventory than a retail network. Amazon achieves about \\n12 turns of inventory annually using warehouse storage, whereas Borders achieves \\nabout two turns using retail stores. \\nTransportation costs are somewhat lower for distributor storage compared to \\nmanufacturer storage because an economic mode of transportation (e.g., truckloads) \\ncan be employed for inbound shipments to the warehouse, which is closer to the cus\\xad\\ntomer. Unlike manufacturer storage, under which multiple shipments may need to go \\nout for a single customer order with multiple items, distributor storage allows out\\xad\\nbound orders to the customer to be bundled into a single shipment, further reducing \\ntransportation cost. Distributor storage provides savings on the transportation of \\nfaster-moving items relative to manufacturer storage. \\nCompared to manufacturer storage, facility costs (of warehousing) are somewhat \\nhigher with distributor storage because of a loss of aggregation. Processing and han\\xad\\ndling costs are comparable to manufacturer storage unless the factory is able to ship to \\nthe end customer directly from the production line. In that case, distributor storage has \\nhigher processing costs. From a facility cost perspective, distributor storage is not \\nappropriate for extremely slow-moving items. \\nThe information infrastructure needed with distributor storage is significantly \\nless complex than that needed with manufacturer storage. The distributor warehouse \\nserves as a buffer between the customer and the manufacturer, decreasing the need \\nto coordinate the two completely. Real-time visibility between customers and the \\nwarehouse is needed, whereas real-time visibility between the customer and \\nthe manufacturer is not. Visibility between the distributor warehouse and manu\\xad\\nfacturer can be achieved at a much lower cost than real-time visibility between the cus\\xad\\ntomer and manufacturer. \\nResponse time under distributor storage is better than under manufacturer stor\\xad\\nage because distributor warehouses are, on average, closer to customers and the entire \\nT I'),\n",

Given the limited radius that can be \\nserved with last-mile delivery, more warehouses are required compared to the case \\nwhen package delivery is used. The warehouse storage with last-mile delivery network \\nis as shown in Figure 4-9. \\nDistributor storage with last-mile delivery requires higher levels of inventory \\nthan the other options (except for retail stores) because it has a lower level of \\naggregation. From an inventory perspective, warehouse storage with last-mile deliv\\xad\\nery is suitable for relatively fast-moving items for which disaggregation does not \\nlead to a significant increase of inventory. Staple items in the grocery industry fit \\nthis description. \\nAmong all the distribution networks, transportation costs are highest for last-mile \\ndelivery. This is because package carriers aggregate delivery across many retailers and \\nare able to obtain better economies of scale than are available to a distributor/retailer \\nattempting last-mile delivery. Delivery costs (including transportation and processing) \\ncan be about $30 to $40 per home delivery in the grocery industry. Last-mile delivery \\nmay be somewhat less expensive in large, dense cities. Transportation costs may also be \\njustifiable for bulky products for which the customer is willing to pay for home deliv\\xad\\nery. Home delivery of water and large bags of rice has proved quite successful in China, \\nwhere the high population density has helped decrease delivery costs. \\nFacility and processing costs are very high using this option, given the large num\\xad\\nber of facilities required. Facility costs are somewhat lower than for a network with \\nretair stores but much higher than for either manufacturer storage or distributor stor\\xad\\nage with package carrier delivery.

The order-tracking fea\\xad ture does become important to handle exceptions in case of incomplete or undeliv\\xad ered orders. Of all the options discussed, returnability is best with last-mile delivery, \\nbecause trucks making deliveries can also pick up returns from customers.

In areas with high labor costs, it is very hard to justify dis\\xad tributor storage with last-mile delivery on the basis of efficiency or improved margin. It can only be justified if there is a large enough customer segment willing to pay for this convenience. In that case, an effort should be made to couple last-mile delivery \\nwith an existing distribution network to exploit economies of scale and improve \\nutilization. An example is Albertsons' use of existing grocery store facilities and labor to provide home delivery. A portion of the grocery store serves as a fulfillment center for online orders as well as a replenishment center for the grocery store itself. This helps improve utilization and lower the cost of providing this service. Last-mile delivery \\nmay be justifiable if customer orders are large enough to provide some economies of scale. Peapod has changed its pricing policies to reflect this idea. Minimum order sizes are for $50 (with a delivery charge of $9.95), and free delivery is no longer provided \\nfor orders of any size. Peapod offers discounts for deliveries during slower periods based on what its schedule looks like.

Orders are shipped from the storage site to \\nthe pickup points as needed. Examples include 7dream.com, operated by Seven\\xad\\nEleven Japan, which allows customers to pick up online orders at a designated store. A \\nbusiness-to-business (B2B) example is W.W. Grainger, whose customers can pick up \\ntheir orders at one of the W.W. Grainger retail outlets. In the case of 7dream.com, the \\norder is delivered from a manufacturer or distributor warehouse to the pickup loca\\xad\\ntion. In the case of W.W. Grainger, some items are stored at the pickup location, \\nwhereas others may come from a central location. The information and product flows \\nin the network for Seven-Eleven Japan are as shown in Figure 4-10. \\nSeven-Eleven has distribution centers where product from manufacturers is cross\\xad\\ndocked and sent to retail outlets on a daily basis. A retailer delivering an online order \\ncan be treated as one of the manufacturers, with deliveries cross-docked and sent to \\nthe appropriate Seven-Eleven outlet. Serving as an outlet for online orders allows \\nSeven-Eleven to improve utilization of its exl.sting logistical assets. \\nInventory costs using this approach can be kept low, with either manufacturer or \\ndistributor storage to exploit aggregation. W.W. Grainger keeps its inventory of fast\\xad\\nmoving items at pickup locations, whereas slow-moving items are stocked at a central \\nwarehouse, or in some cases at the manufacturer. \\nTransportation cost is lower than for any solution using package carriers because \\nsignificant aggregation is possible when delivering orders to a pickup site. This allows \\nthe use of truckload or less-than-truckload carriers to transport orders to the pickup \\nsite. For a company such as Seven-Eleven Japan, the marginal increase in transporta\\xad\\ntion cost is small because trucks are already making deliveries to the stores and their \\nutilization can be improved by including online orders. \\nFacility costs are high if new pickup sites have to be built. A solution using existing \\nsites can lower the additional facility costs. This, for example, is the case with 7dream.com \\nand W.W. Grainger, for which the stores already exist.

The major hurdle is the increased \\nhandling cost at the pickup site. Such a network is likely to be most effective if existing \\nlocations such as coffee shops, convenience stores, or grocery stores are used as pickup \\nsites, because this type of network improves the economies from existing infrastruc\\xad\\nture. Unfortunately, such sites are typically designed to allow the customer to do the \\npicking and need to develop the capability of picking a customer-specific order. \\nRETAIL STORAGE WITH CUSTOMER PICKUP \\nIn this option, often viewed as the most traditional type of supply chain, inventory is \\nstored locally at retail stores. Customers walk into the retail store or place an order \\nonline or by phone and pick it up at the retail store. Examples of companies that offer \\nmultiple options of order placement include Albertsons, which uses part of the facility \\nas a grocery store and part of the facility as an online fulfillment center. Customers can \\nwalk into the store or order online. A B2B example is W.W. Grainger: Customers can \\norder online, by phone, or in person and pick up their order at one of W.W. Grainger's \\nretail outlets. Albertsons keeps its inventory at the pickup location itself. W.W. \\nGrainger stores some items at the pickup locations whereas others may come from a \\ncentral location. \\nLocal storage increases inventory costs because of the lack of aggregation. For \\nvery fast-moving items, however, there is marginal increase in inventory even with \\nlocal storage. Albertsons uses local storage because most of its products are relatively \\nfast moving and are stocked at the supermarket in any case. Similarly, W.W. Grainger \\nkeeps its inventory of fast-moving items at pickup locations, whereas slow-moving \\nitems are stocked at a central warehouse. \\nTransportation cost is much lower than with other solutions because inexpensive \\nmodes of transport can be used to replenish product at the retail store. Facility costs \\nare high because many local facilities are required. A minimal information infrastruc\\xad\\nture is needed if customers walk into the store and place orders. For online orders, \\nhowever, a significant information infrastructure is needed to provide visibility of the \\norder until the customer picks it up. \\nVery good response times can be achieved with this system because of local storage. \\nFor example, both Albertsons and W.W. Grainger offer same-day pickup from their \\nretail locations. Product variety stored locally is lower than under other options. It is \\nmore expensive than with all other options to provide a high level of product availabil\\xad\\nity. Customer experience depends on whether the customer likes to shop or not. Time to \\nmarket is the highest with this option because the new product has to penetrate through \\nthe entire supply chain before it is available to customers. Order visibility is extremely \\nimportant for customer pickups when orders are placed online or by phone. Returns \\ncan be handled at the pickup site. Overall, returnability is fairly good using this option. \\nThe performance characteristics of a network with customer pickup sites and local \\nstorage (such as retail stores) are summarized in Table 4-6. The main advantage of a \\nnetwork with local storage is that it can lower delivery costs and provide a faster \\nresponse than other networks. The major disadvantage is the increased inventory and \\nfacility costs.

The network, however, is tai\\xad\\nlored to match the characteristics of the product and the needs of the customer. Fast\\xad\\nmoving and emergency items are stocked locally, and customers can either pick them up \\nor have them shipped, depending on the urgency. Slower-moving items are stocked at a \\nnational DC and shipped to the customer within a day or two. Very-slow-moving items \\nare typically drop-shipped from the manufacturer and carry a longer lead time. Another \\nhybrid network is used by Amazon, which stocks some items at its warehouses. Other \\nslow-moving items may be drop-shipped from distributors or publishers. \\nWe can now revisit the examples from the computer industry discussed at the \\nbeginning of the chapter. Gateway's decision to create a network of retail stores with\\xad\\nout exploiting any of the supply chain advantages such a network offers was flawed. To \\nfully exploit the benefits of the retail network, Gateway should have stocked its stan\\xad\\ndard configurations (likely to have high demand) at the retail stores, with all other con\\xad\\nfigurations drop-shipped from the factory (perhaps with local pickup at the retail \\nstores if it was economical). Instead, they drop-shipped all configurations from the fac\\xad\\ntory. Apple has opened some retail stores and actually carries products for sale at these \\nstores. This makes sense given the lower level of customization on most Apple prod\\xad\\nucts and the high demand for some of their products such as iPods. In fact, Apple has \\nseen consistent growth in sales and profits through its retail outlets. \\n4.4 E-BUSINESS AND THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK \\nIn this section we use ideas discussed earlier in the chapter to see how the advent of \\ne-business in the late 1990s affected the structure and performance of various distribution \\nnetworks. The goal is to understand what drove the successful introduction of \\ne-business in some networks and not others, and how these networks should evolve. \\nSimilar to our consideration with distribution networks, we build a scorecard \\nbased on how e-business affects a supply chain's ability to meet customer needs and \\nthe cost of meeting those needs.

We also look at fac\\xad\\ntors such as direct sales and the ability to offer flexible pricing that help e-business. \\nResponse Time to Customers \\nIn selling physical products that cannot be downloaded, an e-business without a physi\\xad\\ncal retail outlet takes longer to fulfill a customer request than a retail store because of \\nthe shipping time involved. Thus, customers who require a short response time may not \\nuse the Internet to order a product. There is no such delay, however, for products that \\ncan be downloaded. Going online may offer a time advantage in many cases. For exam\\xad\\nple, a mutual fund prospectus or music can be downloaded from the Web. A physical \\nmailing of these products or even making a trip to a music store takes much longer. \\nProduct Variety \\nAn e-business finds it easier to offer a large selection of products than a bricks\\xad\\nand-mortar store. For example, Amazon.com offers a much larger selection of books \\nthan a typical bookstore. Offering the same selection at a retail store would require a \\nhuge location with a correspondingly large amount of inventory. \\nProduct Availability \\nAn e-business can greatly increase the speed with which information on customer \\ndemand is disseminated throughout the supply chain, giving rise to more accurate fore\\xad\\ncasts. These improved forecasts and the more accurate view of customer demand leads \\nto a better match between supply and demand. On the inventory front, this translates \\ninto having more of the inventory that customers dell\\\\and and less of the inventory \\nthey do not. An e-business also allows for aggregation of inventory that improves prod\\xad\\nuct availability. \\nCustomer Experience \\nAn e-business affects customer experience in terms of access, customization, and \\nconvenience. Unlike most retail stores that are open only during business hours, an \\ne-business allows access to customers who may not be able to place orders during \\nregular business hours. For example, a customer can place an order at Grainger.com \\neven though the W.W. Grainger store where he will pick up his order is closed. \\nIn fact, W.W. Grainger has observed a surge in online orders after their bricks-and\\xad\\nmortar stores close. An e-business also allows a firm to access customers who are \\ngeographically distant. For example, a small specialty retail store located near \\nChicago can reach customers all over the United States, or even the world, by setting \\nup an e-business. Without an e-business, only the customers located near the store \\nare likely to shop there. Access to an e-business is limited only by the customers' \\naccess to the Internet. \\nThe Internet offers an opportunity to create a personalized buying experience for \\neach customer. For example, Amazon displays products that are related to what cus\\xad\\ntomers have recently purchased or browsed. Firms that focus on mass customization \\ncan use the Internet to help customers select a product that suits their needs. For exam\\xad\\nple, Dell allows customers to customize their computers by using the options available \\non the Dell Web site. \\nFor both consumers and companies, e-business can increase the ease with which \\none does business. For instance, customers have the convenience of not needing to \\nleave home or work to make a purchase. An e-business can also help automate the\"),\n",

For example, many e-businesses use data from past \\npurchases to speed up the current purchase. \\nFaster Time to Market ;;.. \\nA firm can use e-business to introduce new products much more t}uickly than a firm \\nthat uses physical channels. A firm that sells PCs through physical channels must pro\\xad\\nduce enough units to stock the shelves at its distributors and retailers before it starts to \\nsee revenue from the new product. An e-business, in contrast, introduces a new product \\nby making it available on the Web site-a distribution lag to fill the physical channels is \\nnot present. A new product can be made available as soon as the first unit is ready to be \\nproduced. This is evident in the computer industry, in which Dell often introduces new \\nproducts earlier than its competitors that use traditional channels. \\nOrder Visibility \\nThe Internet makes it possible to provide visibility of order status. From a customer's \\nperspective, it is crucial to provide this visibility because an online order has no physi\\xad\\ncal equivalent to a customer shopping for an item at a retail store. \\nReturnability \\nReturnability is harder with online orders, which typically arrive from a centralized \\nlocation. It is much easier to return a product purchased at a retail store. The propor\\xad\\ntion of returns is also likely to be much higher for online orders because customers are \\nunable to touch and feel the product before their purchase. Going online thus \\nincreases the cost of reverse flows. \\nDirect Sales to Customers \\nAn e-business allows manufacturers and other members of the supply chain that do \\nnot have direct contact with customers in traditional channels to enhance revenues by \\nbypassing intermediaries and selling directly to customers, thereby collecting the inter\\xad\\nmediary's incremental revenue. For example, Dell sells PCs online direct to customers. \\nAs a result, Dell is able to increase revenue and enhance margins because it shares no \\npart of the revenue with a distributor or retailer. In contrast, HP, which sells through \\nretailers, must share some of the product revenue with the distributor and retailer, \\nresulting in lower revenue and margins for HP. \\nFlexible Pricing, Product Portfolio, and Promotions \\nAn e-:business can easily alter prices by changing one entry in the database linked to its \\nWeb site. This ability allows an e-business to maximize revenues by setting prices based \\non current inventories and demand. The airlines provide a good example of this \\nability-they make last-minute, low-cost fares available on the Web on routes with \\nunsold seats. Dell also changes prices for different PC configurations regularly, based \\non demand and component availability. Firms can change prices at an e-business much \\nmore easily than most traditional channels can. If Dell or L.L.Bean were to use paper \\ncatalogs to convey a discount in prices, they would have to print new catalogs and mail \\nthem to potential customers. With an e-business, however, they only have to update the \\nprice on their Web site. Similarly, an e-business can easily alter the product portfolio \\nthat it offers as well as the promotions it is running. \\nEfficient Funds Transfer \\nAn e-business can enhance revenues by speeding up collection. An excellent example \\nshows howe-business affects areas even outside the business world. Within 48 hours \\nof John McCain's 2000 Presidential primary victory in New Hampshire, Senator\"),\n",

In contrast, it would \\nhave taken much more time and effort to process all the payments if the campaign \\nwas receiving checks by mail. \\nIMPACT OF E-BUSINESS ON COST \\nOn the cost side, e-business affects inventory, facilities, transportation, and information \\ncosts. It is important to observe that the impact in each case is not necessarily positive. \\nInventory \\nAn e-business can lower inventory levels and inventory cost by improving supply \\nchain coordination and creating a better match between supply and demand. \\nAdditionally, e-business enables a firm to aggregate inventories far from customers if \\nmost customers are willing to wait for delivery of online orders. As a result of geo\\xad\\ngraphic aggregation, an e-business requires less inventory. For example, Amazon. com \\nis able to aggregate its inventory of books and music at a few warehouses. Borders and \\nBarnes&N oble, in contrast, need more inventory because they must carry a significant \\nportion of their stock at retail stores. A key point to note is that the relative benefit of \\naggregation is small for high-demand items with low variability but large for low\\xad\\ndemand items with high variability. \\nAn e-business can significantly lower its inventories if it can postpone the introduc\\xad\\ntion of variety until after the customer order is received. The time lag between when a \\ncustomer places the order and when he expects delivery offers an e-business a window \\nof opportunity to implement postponement. For example, Dell keeps its inventory as \\ncomponents and assembles its PCs after receiving the customer order. The amount of \\ncomponent inventory required is much lower than it would be if Dell kept its invento\\xad\\nries in the form of assembled PCs. Its e-business thus allows Dell to hold less inventory \\nrelative to a firm carrying its inventory at retail stores in finished-goods form. \\nFacilities \\nTwo basic types of facilities costs must be included in the analysis: costs related to the \\nnumber and location of facilities in a network, and costs associated with the operations \\nthat take place in these facilities. An e-business can reduce network facility costs by cen\\xad\\ntralizing operations, thereby decreasing the number of facilities required. For example, \\nAmazon. com is able to satisfy demand from a few warehouses, whereas Borders and \\nBarnes&Noble must incur facility costs for all the retail outlets they operate. \\nWith regard to ongoing operating costs, customer participation in selection and \\norder placement allows an e-business to lower its resource costs. For example, when a \\ncustomer goes to the Lands' End Web site, she makes the effort to check on product \\navailability and then place her order. When the same customer phones in an order, the \\nfirm incurs the additional cost of its employees checking product availability and plac\\xad\\ning the order. An e-business can lower its order fulfillment costs because it does not \\nhave to fill an order as soon as it arrives. A retail store or supermarket must staff its \\nsales counters so that more cashiers are available when more customers are shopping. \\nAs a result, these stores require greater staffing during weekends and at times when \\npeople are not at work. At an e-business, if a reasonable buffer of unfilled orders is \\nmaintained, the rate of order fulfillment can be made significantly smoother than the \\nrate at which orders arrive, which reduces the peak load for order fulfillment and thus \\nreduces resource requirements and cost. \\nAdditionally, operating costs can be decreased for a manufacturer using e-business \\nto sell direct to customers because fewer supply chain stages touch the product as it \\nmakes its way to a customer, thereby reducing handling costs.\"),\n",

In such situations, an e-business will incur \\nhigher handling and delivery costs than a retail store. For example, whereas a customer \\npicks out the required items at a grocery store, an e-business such as Peapod incurs \\nhigher handling costs because its employees must pick-a customer's order from the \\nwarehouse shelves and deliver it to the customer's home.

The scorecard in Table 4-9 can be used to under\\xad\\nstand how e-business affects the performance of different supply chain networks. In \\nthe next section, we apply the e-business scorecard to several examples. \\nUSING E-BUSINESS TO SELL PCs: DELL \\nThe PC industry in general-and Dell in particular-has used e-business effectively to \\nimprove performance of supply chain networks. As shown in Figure 4-ll,Dell sells PCs \\ndirectly to customers, both companies and consumers, and starts assembly after receiv\\xad\\ning a customer order (shown by the fact that Dell is above the push/pull boundary). \\nTraditional PC manufacturers, in contrast, assemble the PC in the push phase of the \\nsupply chain because they must maintain assembled products available for purchase at \\na retail store. \\nImpact of e-Business on Customer Service in the PC Industry \\nThe main disadvantage for Dell of selling PCs over the Internet is that customers who \\nare unwilling to wait five to 10 days to receive their order cannot be attracted. A PC, \\nhowever, is usually a planned purchase; most people are willing to wait for its delivery. \\nDell also does not attract customers who need a lot of help when selecting a PC. \\nHowever, the segment of people who are comfortable selecting their own PC and are \\nwilling to wait for its delivery is quite large and still growing. Dell and other PC manu\\xad\\nfacturers who sell over the Internet target this group of customers. \\nDell is able to exploit most of the responsiveness-enhancing opportunities \\noffered by an e-business. The company uses the Internet to offer a very wide variety of \\ndifferent PC configurations. Customers are allowed to select recommended PC con\\xad\\nfigurations or customize them to have the desired processor, memory, hard drive, and \\nother components. Customization allows Dell to satisfy customers by giving them a \\nproduct that is close to their specific requirements. The customization options are very \\neasy to display over the Internet, allowing Dell to attract customers who value this \\nchoice. Dell also uses customized Web pages to enable large business customers to \\nplace orders. \\nThe Internet allows Dell to bring new products to market more quickly than com\\xad\\npetitors who sell through retail stores. This is particularly important because products \\nin the PC industry have short life cycles of a few months. Competing firms that sell \\nthrough distributors and retailers need to fill shelves at their distributors and retailers \\nbefore a product reaches the customer. Dell, in contrast, introduces a new product to \\ncustomers on the Internet as soon as the first PC of that model is ready to be assem\\xad\\nbled. As a result, Dell can offer new components in its products as soon as they are \\navailable. It takes PC manufacturers who sell through distributors and retailers much \\nlonger to bring new components to market.'),\n",

The company has designed its products and assembly process to \\nassemble the customized PC after a customer order arrives. Without the direct interac\\xad\\ntion between the consumer and Dell that e-business affords, Dell\\'s reaction would be \\nslower, and the company could not be as responsive with customized products. \\nDecreasing the response time by a few days allows Dell to attract more time-sensitive \\ncustomers. \\nDell also uses the price flexibility the Internet offers to increase revenues. The \\nsalespeople at Dell change prices and delivery time daily, based on demand and supply \\nof components, in order to maximize the revenue that can be extracted from available \\nresources. To spur sales, the company lowers prices on configurations that contain com\\xad\\nponents with excess inventory. \\nBy using the Internet to sell PCs directly to customers, Dell is able to eliminate dis\\xad\\ntributor and retailer margins and increase its own margin. The Internet allows Dell cus\\xad\\ntomers to place orders at any time of the day. Relative to other channels, the Internet \\nmakes it much cheaper to provide access by decreasing the workforce required. \\nComputer stores, for example, would find it very expensive to stay open all the time. \\nHaving an e-business allows Dell to collect payment for its PCs in a matter of days \\nafter they are sold. Dell, however, pays its suppliers according to the more traditional \\nschedules in which payment is due in weeks (e.g., 30 days). Given its low levels of \\ninventory, Dell is able to operate its business with negative working capital because it \\nreceives payment for its PCs about 30 days before it pays its suppliers for their compo\\xad\\nnents. A PC supply chain including distributors and retailers cannot achieve these \\nresults. \\nImpact of e-Business on Cost in the PC Industry \\nInventory Costs. Its e-Business offers Dell the ability to reduce its inventories by \\naggregating them in a few geographic locations, whereas a chain of retail stores selling \\ncomputers must carry inventory in each store. Dell is able to further reduce inventories \\nby exploiting the time that elapses from the point at which an online order arrives to \\nthe point at which it must be shipped. Dell products and assembly lines are designed so \\nthat all components on which customers are offered customization can be assembled in \\na very short period of time. This allows Dell to postpone assembly until after the cus\\xad\\ntomer order has been placed. As a result, Dell holds all inventories in the form of com\\xad\\nponents that are common across multiple finished products. Postponement, coupled \\nwith component commonality, allows Dell to reduce inventories significantly. \\nA PC manufacturer that sells through distributors and retailers finds it difficult to \\nimplement postponement. As a result, traditional PC manufacturers often find that \\nthey are stuck with PC configurations that are not selling while simultaneously being \\nout of the configurations that are selling. Dell, in contrast, is better able to match sup\\xad\\nply and demand. \\nFacility Costs. Its e-Business allows the Dell supply chain to lower facility costs \\nbecause the company has no physical distribution or retail outlets. Dell incurs only the \\ncost of the manufacturing facility and warehousing space for components.

As a result of e-business, total transportation costs in the \\nDell supply chain are higher than in a supply chain selling PCs through distributors \\nand retailers. Dell sends individual PCs to customers from its factories, whereas a man\\xad\\nufacturer selling through distributors and retailers sends large shipments on trucks to \\nwarehouses and to retailers. The Dell supply chain thus has higher outbound trans\\xad\\nportation costs. Relative to the price of a high-end PC, however, the outbound trans\\xad\\nportation cost is low (typically 2 to 3 percent) and thus it does not have a major impact \\non the overall cost. \\nInformation Costs. Although Dell has made a significant investment in informa\\xad\\ntion technology to implement its build-to-order model, these costs are more than made \\nup for by the benefits discussed earlier. Additionally, the majority of these IT costs \\nwould be incurred regardless of Dell's e-business status. Therefore, e-business does add \\nincrementally to Dell's information costs, but this is not a significant factor given the \\nbenefits. \\nImpact of e-Business on Performance at Dell \\nAs summarized in thee-business scorecard in Table 4-10, e-business allows Dell to sig\\xad\\nnificantly improve its performance in terms of both responsiveness and cost.

A careful study, however, indicates that a traditional PC manufacturer, sell\\xad\\ning through distributors and retailers, can gain a lot by incorporating the Internet into \\nits existing network. This issue becomes more significant as hardware becomes more \\nof a commodity. The PC manufacturer should use an e-business to sell new products \\nor customized PC configurations whose demand is hard to forecast and let the \\nretail channel sell standard configurations whose demand is easier to forecast. \\nManufacturers should introduce new models on the Internet, and as demand for some \\nof them grows, these models should be added to the retail channel.

The manufacturer is thus able to decrease \\ninventories by aggregating all high-variability production and satisfying that demand \\nonline. These models should be built to order using as many common components as is \\nfeasible. The standard models can be produced using a low-cost approach even if it \\ninvolves longer lead time. Selling standardized models through distributors and retail \\nstores allows the supply chain to save on transportation costs, which are likely to be \\nmore significant for these low-cost configurations. Retailers can be allowed to partici\\xad\\npate in the e-business by having kiosks where customers can configure models of their \\nchoice or order standardized models that are out of stock. It is important that tradi\\xad\\ntional PC manufacturers give retailers a chance to participate in any e-business to \\navoid damaging existing channel relationships. \\nA traditional manufacturer can use the two-pronged approach outlined earlier to \\nutilize both the strengths of e-business and those of traditi9nal retail and distribution \\nchannels. Gateway failed in its effort with retail stores because it did not use any of the \\nsupply chain strengths of the bricks-and-mortar channel. Instead of just helping people \\nwith configuration at their retail stores, Gateway would have served its customers bet\\xad\\nter by also carrying recommended configurations of their PCs in the stores. This would \\nimmediately satisfy customers who wanted the recommended configuration, while \\nallowing Gateway to produce the more customized configurations efficiently. \\nUSING E-BUSINESS TO SELL BOOKS: AMAZON \\nBook supply chains have been transformed with the advent of e-business and the \\nlaunching of Amazon.com in July 1995. Since 1995, Amazon.com has added music, \\ntoys, electronics, software, and home improvement equipment to its product offerings. \\nIt is fair to state, however, that the growth in profitability that the Internet has brought \\nto the book industry has been less than in the PC industry. \\nImpact of e-Business on Customer Service in the Book Industry \\nThere are several reasons why e-business has not helped profits in the book industry to \\nthe same extent as in the PC industry. Unlike the PC industry, in which e-business facil\\xad\\nitates direct sales by manufacturers, e-business has not shortened supply chains in the \\nbook industry. \\nAs is the case with Dell, customers wanting a book quickly cannot shop at \\nAmazon.com. Thus Amazon.com can only attract customers who are willing to wait a \\nfew days to get a book.Amazon.com also cannot attract customers who value the abil\\xad\\nity to leaf through books. The company tries to counter this problem by providing \\nreviews and other information on books to allow customers to get a feel for the book \\nonline. \\nTo counter these drawbacks, Amazon.com has exploited several opportunities on \\nthe Internet to attract customers and increase revenues. Amazon.com attracts many \\ncustomers by offering a wide selection of millions of books. Customers can search for \\nhard-to-find books or those of special interest. A large physical bookstore, in contrast, \\ncan carry fewer than a hundred thousand titles. Amazon.com also uses the Internet to \\nrecommend books to customers based on their purchase history. Customers are sent \\ne-mails informing them of new titles that match their interests. Amazon.com also pro\\xad\\nvides reviews and comments from other customers on the titles available. New titles \\nare quickly introduced and made available online, whereas in a bricks-and-mortar \\nbookstore chain, all retail stores have to be stocked. \\nAmazon.com uses the Internet to allow customers to order a book at any time \\nfrom the comfort of their own home. If customers know the books they want, they can'),\n",

There is no need to \\nleave the house and spend an hour or two going to a physical bookstore. This fact \\nallows Amazon. com to attract customers who value this convenience and are willing to \\nwait for delivery. \\nCost Impact of e-Business on the Book Industry \\nAmazon.com also uses e-business to lower its inventory and some of its facility costs. \\nTransportation costs, however, increase as a result of selling books online. \\nInventory Costs. Amazon.com is able to decrease inventories by aggregating \\ninventories in a few geographical locations. A bookstore chain, in contrast, has higher \\ninventories because titles are carried at every store. The reduction of inventories from \\naggregation is most significant for low-demand books with high demand uncertainty. \\nThe benefit is less significant for best-sellers with demand that is more predictable. \\nAmazon.com carries high-demand titles in inventory, whereas it purchases low\\xad\\ndemand titles from a distributor in response to a customer order. This allows the \\nAmazon.com supply chain to further reduce inventories of low-demand titles because \\ndistributors are able to aggregate across other booksellers in addition to Amazon. \\nFacility Costs. Its e-business allows Amazon.com to lower facility costs because it \\ndoes not need the retail infrastructure that a bookstore chain such as Borders or \\nBarnes&Noble must have. Initially,Amazon.com did not have a warehouse, purchasing \\nall books from distributors. When demand volumes were low, the distributor was a bet\\xad\\nter location to carry inventories because it aggregated demand across other book\\xad\\nsellers besides Amazon.com. As demand has grown, however, Amazon.com has \\nopened its own warehouses, where it stocks high-demand books. Amazon.com now \\npurchases high-demand books directly from publishers and goes to distributors for \\nlower-demand books only. Thus, facility costs at Amazon.com are growing, though they \\nare still much lower than the facility costs for a bookstore chain because Amazon.com \\nhas no retail sites. \\nTransportation Costs. The Amazon.com supply chain incurs higher transporta\\xad\\ntion costs than a bookstore chain selling through retail stores. Local bookstores do not \\nhave the cost of individually shipping books to customers. Amazon.com, in contrast, \\nincurs the cost of shipping books to its customers from warehouses. The shipping cost \\nfrom an Amazon. com warehouse represents a significant fraction of the cost of a book \\n(it can be even higher than 100 percent for an inexpensive book). As demand has \\ngrown, Amazon.com has opened several warehouses in an effort to get closer to cus\\xad\\ntomers, decrease its transportation costs, and improve response time. \\nInformation Costs. As with Dell, setting up an e-business takes some additional \\ninvestment in IT, but this is not incrementally significant compared with the IT that is \\nrequired to run a bricks-and-mortar business. Therefore, IT costs for e-business are \\nsomewhat higher, but not prohibitively so. \\nImpact of e-Business on Performance at Amazon \\nAmazon's e-business scorecard is summarized in Table 4-11. A comparison of Tables 4-10 \\nand 4-11 shows that e-business offers far greater advantages when selling PCs than \\nwhen selling books. Some key differences between the two products are that (1) prod\\xad\\nuct differentiation in PCs can be postponed until after the customer has placed an \\norder, whereas books are currently published well in advance of a sale; and (2) trans\\xad\\nportation cost represents a much higher portion of the cost of books and a relatively \\nsmall portion of the cost of PCs. If books become downloadable, Amazon.com will be \\nable to exploit all the advantages that Dell currently exploits, along with being able to\"),\n",

Let us take a look with our scorecard to see \\nwhether this is the case.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat 10.0 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'PdfCompressor 3.1.34', 'creationdate': 'D:2010m`ûà\\x85Ã\\x87EôÄéÒ\\x87¾i\\x00õ\\x1aX\\x84\\x8ac\\x8f^¸c×jþ~õça}`\\x8c\\x07£&\\x82êk\\x15Ë1¡©', 'creationdate--text': 'D:2010m`ÇE҇i', 'moddate': '2010-12-08T21:52:11+04:00', 'source': 'D:\\\\KGP Notes\\\\6th Sem\\\\Information Systems Project\\\\Logistics-and-Supply-Chain-Management-Sunil-Chopra-1.pdf', 'total_pages': 543, 'page': 116, 'page_label': '117'}, page_content=\"CHAPTER 4 + Designing Distribution Networks and Applications to e-Business 105 \\nPeapod started by supplying orders using employees at grocery stores to pick and \\ndeliver orders. The company has now moved to supplying orders from centralized ful\\xad\\nfillment centers and also some large supermarkets. Each fulfillment center is much \\nlarger than a supermarket and is comparable to a warehouse. The Peapod and super\\xad\\nmarket supply chains are comparable except that for a supermarket, some products \\ncome from a warehouse whereas the rest come directly from suppliers. \\nImpact of e-Business on Customer Service in the Grocery Industry \\nPeapod and other online groceries have tried to sell convenience and the time savings \\nthey offer customers. For many people, grocery shopping is a chore that is time con\\xad\\nsuming and rarely enjoyable. Peapod allows customers to place orders at any time and \\nhave them delivered at home, eliminating a trip to the supermarket. This can be a sig\\xad\\nnificant convenience, especially in urban areas, where customers have to walk to a \\nsupermarket and carry all their groceries home. In a suburban area, the benefit is \\nsmaller because people can drive to supermarkets with relative ease. The convenience \\nof saving time, however, remains quite valuable. \\nThe convenience factor related to access is even more significant if a specialty\\xad\\nfood provider goes online. For example, ethnic food stores are not as accessible as \\nsupermarkets and people often drive long distances to reach them. Offering ethnic \\nfoods on the Internet provides easy access to customers and saves a long drive. \\nEthnicgrocer.com is an e-business that specializes in, as the name suggests, ethnic gro\\xad\\nceries and products. Peapod, however, does not offer significantly more variety than a \\ntypical supermarket. Most large supermarkets offer sufficiently large variety to cover \\nthe needs of most households. \\nPeapod is able to increase revenues by creating a personalized shopping experi\\xad\\nence for customers and delivering customized, one-to-one advertising and promotions. \\nThis is done using extensive member profiles that Peapod creates based on online \\nshopping behavior, purchase histories, and surveys. Unlike a supermarket, where the \\nstore does not know what customers have selected until they check out, Peapod can \\nguide online customers based on what they purchase. For example, if a customer buys \\nsome pasta, Peapod can suggest a type of pasta sauce or some Parmesan cheese. Over \\nlonger periods, Peapod can collect shopping patterns and suggest products that match \\na customer's preferences. Such suggestions enhance revenues by increasing customers' \\nimpulse purchases. \\nPeapod also adds to its revenues by giving consumer goods companies a forum for \\ntargeted interactive advertising and electronic coupons. Peapod increases revenues by \\nselling data on consumer choices to product manufacturers. Consumer choice data \\navailable to an online grocer is more valuable than scanner data from a supermarket \\nbecause scanner data only reveals the customer's final purchases. An online grocer, in \\ncontrast, can record the customer's decision process. For example, an online grocer can \\nrecord a customer's substitution patterns for items that are out of stock. With scanner \\ndata, a supermarket cannot record substitutions because it has no way of finding out if \\nthe customer looked for something that is out of stock. \\nImpact of e-Business on Costs in the Grocery Industry \\nPeapod and other online grocers use e-business to lower some facility costs and, to an \\nextent, inventory costs. Picking costs and transportation costs, however, are much \\nhigher than for traditional supermarkets. \\nInventory Costs. Compared to a supermarket chain, an online grocer such as \\nPeapod can lower inventories by aggregating the inventory in a few large replenish\\xad\\nment centers. The degree of aggregation, however, is less than that achieved by\"),\n",

Thus, aggregation \\nprovides a marginal benefit in terms of improved forecast accuracy and reduced invento\\xad\\nries (see Chapter 11). The benefits of aggregation are higher for specialty, low-demand \\nitems with high demand uncertainty. These products constitute a small fraction of over\\xad\\nall sales at a supermarket. Thus, aggregation allows e-grocers to lower their inventory \\ncosts only marginally compared to a typical supermarket. If online grocers focused pri\\xad\\nmarily on specialty items such as ethnic foods, the inventory benefits of aggregation \\nwould be larger. \\nFacility Costs. Peapod's e-business allows it to lower facility costs because it needs \\nonly warehouse facilities and can save on the cost of retail outlets such as supermar\\xad\\nkets. Processing costs at Peapod to fulfill an order, however, are significantly higher \\nthan those for a supermarket, and overwhelm the savings from needing fewer facilities. \\nPeapod saves on checkout clerks compared to a supermarket but must pick the cus\\xad\\ntomer order, a task the customer performs at a supermarket and one that is much more \\ntime consuming than checkout. Thus, e-business results in a loss of customer participa\\xad\\ntion compared to a supermarket and raises overall facility costs. \\nTransportation. An online grocer such as Peapod has significantly higher trans\\xad\\nportation costs than a supermarket. Supermarkets have the advantage of having to \\nbear only inbound transportation cost for products, with customers providing trans\\xad\\nportation from the supermarket to their homes. Inbound transportation costs tend to \\nbe low because supermarkets have large deliveries that enable them to exploit \\neconomies of scale in transportation. Peapod, in contrast, has to bear inbound trans\\xad\\nportation cost to its fulfillment centers and then outbound delivery costs from the \\nfulfillment centers to customer homes. Outbound delivery costs are high, because \\nindividual orders must be delivered to each customer's home. The task becomes all \\nthe more problematic given the different temperature requirements for different \\ntypes of food. \\nCompared to computers and even books, groceries have a low value-to-weight/ \\nvolume ratio. For example, paper towels and bathroom tissues have very low value but \\noccupy a lot of space in a truck. Thus, transportation costs are a significant fraction of \\nthe cost incurred by online grocers. This makes it very difficult for an online grocer to \\ncompete with a supermarket on prices. \\nInformation Costs. Again, the IT infrastructure required for an e-business \\nincreases costs. In the case of an e-grocer, this is somewhat more significant than with \\nthe other e-businesses we have been discussing, because an e-grocer takes on a wider \\nrange of functions that shoppers do themselves. Therefore, IT costs are higher for an \\ne-grocer. As in the other examples, however, IT costs are not a deal breaker for this \\nbusiness model. \\nImpact of e-Business on Performance at Peapod \\nAn e-business offers some revenue-enhancement opportunities in the grocery indus\\xad\\ntry. Costs, however, are significantly higher for an online grocer than for a supermar\\xad\\nket, as we can see from Table 4-12. A comparison of Tables 4-10,4-11, and 4-12 shows \\nthat e-business offers fewer benefits when selling groceries compared to books and \\nPCs. Supermarkets are large enough to enjoy most of the inventory benefits that aggre\\xad\\ngation offers, without having the additional delivery cost incurred by an online grocer. \\nOnline grocers cannot compete with supermarkets on price, and can succeed only if\"),\n",

Thee-business can be used to offer convenience to \\ncustomers who are willing to pay for it. Supermarkets can be used to target customers \\nwho value lower prices. \\nA supermarket chain with an e-business has the opportunity to offer an entire \\narray of services at differing prices based on the amount of work the customer does. \\nThe cheapest service involves customers walking into the supermarket and shopping \\nfor the products they want. In this case, the customer picks the order from the shelves \\nand provides outbound transportation for it. For an additional charge, a supermarket \\nmight allow customers to place orders online to be picked up at a later time. The super\\xad\\nmarket personnel would pick the order from the shelf, but the customer would provide \\noutbound transportation. The most expensive service is when the customer places \\norders online for home delivery. In this case the supermarket chain is responsible for \\nboth picking the order from the shelf and delivering it to the customer's home. The \\nvarying services and prices would allow supermarket chains to efficiently satisfy the \\nneeds of a variety of customers. \\nAmong the supermarket chains, Albertsons has taken the lead in combining \\ne-business with physical supermarkets. It has renamed some of its stores Albertsons. \\ncom. Half the store remains a traditional supermarket, while the other half is used to \\nfulfill online grocery orders. This allows the firm to exploit economies of scale on \\ninbound transportation while keeping delivery distances to customers short on the \\noutbound side. Customers are allowed to pick up their orders at the store or have \\nthe order delivered to their home. Based on our analysis, the Albertsons model is \\nlikely to be the most effective method for combining e-business with existing super\\xad\\nmarkets in the grocery industry, whereas pure online grocers are likely to be less \\neffective.\"),\n",

The Internet allows W.W. \\nGrainger to enhance revenues by introducing a new product as soon as it becomes \\navailable. With directmail marketing, W.W. Grainger had to wait for a new catalog to be \\nshipped before customers were informed about new products. An e-business also \\nallows W.W. Grainger to offer promotions and change prices easily without having to \\nsend out new catalogs. \\nGrainger.com allows customers to place orders and check their status at any time. \\nThis is a significant benefit to customers, who can use this ability to improve their \\nMRO purchase process. For example, a customer's night-shift personnel can use the \\nInternet to place and check on orders for supplies they need. They no longer have to \\nwait for people from the day shift to place their order. This improves the accuracy of \\norders and reduces the time needed to process them. A study by the Aberdeen Group \\nindicates that online purchases decrease the duration of the order and fulfillment cycle \\nfrom an average of 7.3 days to an average of 2 days. The decreased order-fulfillment \\ntimes allow W.W. Grainger to attract more orders through its e-business. A study by \\nW.W. Grainger Consulting estimates that MRO distributors could see incremental \\nsales gains of 10 to 20 percent by selling online. \\nProduct margins, however, are likely to drop as a result of e-business in the MRO \\nsupply industry. With customers able to compare prices easily over the Internet, the \\ngrowth in e-business has put pressure on MRO supply companies to lower price. \\nImpact of e-Business on Costs at W.W. Grainger \\nW.W. Grainger uses e-business to lower its order processing costs and to some extent \\nits facility costs. Notably, W.W. Grainger customers also see a significant reduction in \\norder processing costs as a result of e-business. \\nInventory Costs. With an increase in Internet orders that are shipped by package \\ncarrier, W.W. Grainger is able to aggregate more of it's inventories, resulting in some \\ninventory reduction. W.W. Grainger will achieve further inventory reduction if \\nonline sales grow large enough to enable the company to close some of its branches. \\n--------\"),\n",

Some gains are also achieved because of \\nthe ability to display a wider variety of products and increased customer convenience \\nin product search. The structure of the MRO supply chain, however, is not significantly \\ndifferent for online orders compared to phone orders. Thus, gains from an improved \\nsupply chain structure are minimal. \\n4.5 DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS IN PRACTICE \\n1. The ownership structure of the distribution network can have as big an impact as \\nthe type of distribution network. The bulk of this chapter deals with different types of \\nphysical networks and subsequent flows to distribute products successfully. However, \\nequally important is who owns each stage in the distribution network. Distribution net\\xad\\nworks that have exactly the same physical flow but different ownership structures can \\nhave vastly different performance. For example, a manufacturer that owns its distribu\\xad\\ntion network can control the network's actions. However, if the manufacturer does not \\nown the distribution network, as is more often the case, a wide variety of issues need to \\nbe taken into account to optimize over the network. Obviously, an independent dis\\xad\\ntributor wants to optimize its own enterprise, not necessarily the entire supply chain. \\nAttempting to optimize over a distribution network with multiple enterprises requires \\ngreat skill in coordinating the incentives of each of the players and in creating the right \\nrelationships. Be sure to consider the impact of both the physical flows and the owner\\xad\\nship structure when designing a distribution network. \\n2. The choice of a distribution network has very long-term consequences. The \\nstructure of the distribution network is one of the most difficult decisions to change. \\nThe impact often lasts for decades, amplifying the importance of the choice. For \\nexample, in the United States, auto manufacturers sell virtually all of their vehicles to \\nconsumers through a network of independent dealers set up decades ago. Because \\ndealers are the interface between the consumer and the automotive supply chain, \\nauto manufacturers are very interested in influencing dealers to ensure that this is a \\npositive relationship. However, given that dealers are independent, they have a some\\xad\\nwhat different set of goals that is not necessarily consistent with the manufacturers. \\nFurther complicating this is the fact that dealers often have relationships with more \\nthan one manufacturer and have successfully encouraged legislation that makes it \\nvery difficult for manufacturers to use any other distribution channel. Although \\nautomakers have tried to implement alternative distribution channels for several \\nyears, the dealers have kept the manufacturers captive, remaining the only channel \\nthrough which cars are sold. \\nAnother example of long-term consequences is seen within the PC industry. In \\nthe early days, manufacturers sold through independent distributors and retailers. \\nDell's emergence was a clear example of how the direct model was often superior to \\nthe traditional model. Other PC manufacturers, such as HP, made forays into selling \\nPCs directly. However, their existing distribution channels reacted quite negatively \\nto this-as you might expect, given that it would cannibalize their business. Because \\ndistributors often sold other companies' PCs, manufacturers were hesitant, to \\npromote their direct efforts aggressively, for fear of their distributors retaliating by \\npromoting competitors' products. These PC manufacturers therefore ended up with \\nminimal direct business. The manufacturers were essentially shackled by their legacy \\ndistribution network. The only way to go direct was a clean break-a move that was\"),\n",

These examples illustrate the long-term implications of choosing the right \\ndistribution network. \\n3. Consider whether an exclusive distribution strategy is advantageous. Another \\nimportant choice is whether to distribute exclusively or not. For instance, a manufac\\xad\\nturer of consumer electronics such as Sony could choose to have relationships with \\nmany distributors such as Best Buy, Circuit City, and Wal-Mart. In this case, Sony would \\nbe interested in increasing the availability of its products to customers and would cer\\xad\\ntainly not mind if its distributors competed with each other to sell Sony products to cus\\xad\\ntomers. An alternative, which is more plausible for a manufacturer of very-high-end \\nstereo equipment, is to form an exclusive relationship with a distributor. In this case, \\ncustomers can buy this brand\\'s products only from a single retailer. The retailer can gar\\xad\\nner higher margins, as it doesn\\'t have to battle over price with a nearby store. But what\\'s \\nin it for the manufacturer? The manufacturer can often increase its sales significantly, \\nbecause its exclusive distributor will be much more intel\"ested in marketing the manu\\xad\\nfacturer\\'s goods, as there is a higher margin and less competition. \\n4. Product price, commoditization, and criticality affect the type of distribution sys\\xad\\ntem preferred by customers. Interactions between a buyer and a seller take time and \\nresources. Many buyers would like to establish a relationship with a single enterprise \\nthat can deliver a full line of products. This can be accomplished by a manufacturer \\nwith a broad line of products. However, this is often accomplished more effectively \\nby a distributor carrying products from many manufacturers. A customer\\'s desire for \\na one-stop shop depends not just on the convenience of the relationship, but also on \\nthe type of product he or she is buying. The more differentiated an item is, the more \\nlikely that a customer will be willing to have a relationship solely around that partic\\xad\\nular product. \\nFor example, a consumer may well be content to buy a PC directly from a manu\\xad\\nfacturer. However, very few consumers are willing to order pens direct from a pen \\nmanufacturer, paper directly from a paper manufacturer, and staples directly from a \\nstaple manufacturer. Most consumers much prefer a stationary store that carries a \\nvery wide range of different manufacturers\\' products. Even if a pen manufacturer \\ncould economically deliver individual pens to customers\\' homes, the hassle for the \\nconsumer of dealing with different entities for each type of office product would be \\nprohibitive. \\n5. Integrate the Internet with the existing physical network. To extract maximum \\nbenefit from e-business, firms should integrate it with their existing supply chain net\\xad\\nworks. Separating the two networks often results in inefficiencies within the supply \\nchain. This coupling of e-business with the existing physical network has been referred \\nto as clicks-and-mortar. \\nAlberstons use of its physical assets to satisfy both online orders and people who \\nwant to shop in a supermarket is an effective integration of e-business within a supply \\nchain network. Another example of an effective clicks-and-mortar strategy is The Gap, \\nwhich allows customers to place online orders through computers placed in the stores \\nand also return items purchased online at retail stores. The Internet is used to expand the \\nvariety available to customers at a Gap store. Gap stores stock popular items, whereas \\ncustomers can order online the colors or sizes that may not be available in the store. This \\nallows the Gap to centralize low-demand items while increasing the variety available to \\ncustomers and extracting the maximum benefit from integrating its e-business with its \\nphysical network.'),\n",

Identify factors to be considered when designing the distribution network. \\nA manager must consider the customer needs to be met and the cost of meeting these \\nneeds when designing the distribution network. Some key customer needs to be considered \\ninclude response time, product variety/availability, convenience, order visibility, and return\\xad\\nability. Important costs that managers must consider include inventories, transportation, \\nfacilities and handling, and information. Increasing the number of facilities decreases the \\nresponse time and transportation cost but increases inventory and facility cost. \\n2. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various distribution options. \\nDistribution networks that ship directly to the customer are better suited for a large \\nvariety of high-value products that have low and uncertain demand. These networks carry \\nlow levels of inventory but incur high transportation cost and provide a slow response time. \\nDistribution networks that carry local inventory are suitable for products with high demand, \\nespecially if transportation is a large fraction of total cost. These networks incur higher \\ninventory cost but lower transportation cost and provide a faster response time. \\n3. Understand how e-business has affected the design of distribution networks in various \\nindustries. \\nThe rise of e-businesses has affected both customer service and costs in supply chains. \\nAn e-business allows a firm to offer greater product variety and improve product availabil\\xad\\nity by centralizing inventories. This is especially beneficial for low-volume, high-variety \\nproducts. An e-business also improves the customer experience by providing 24-hour access \\nand allowing a more customized experience. Selling a product online, however, increases the \\nresponse time relative to a retail store. An e-business reduces facility costs if there is no sig\\xad\\nnificant loss of customer participation. Transportation costs increase, however, and this is \\nparticularly significant for low-value products with predictable demand. An e-business has \\nbeen most effective for high-value products with uncertain demand, when customers are \\nwilling to wait some time before delivery. \\nDiscussion Questions \\n1. What differences in the retail environment may justify the fact that the fast-moving \\nconsumer goods supply chain in India has far more distributors than in the United States? \\n2. A specialty chemical company is considering expanding its operations into Brazil, where five \\ncompanies dominate the consumption of specialty chemicals. What sort of distribution net\\xad\\nwork should this company utilize? \\n3. A distributor has heard that one of the major manufacturers from which it buys is consider\\xad\\ning going direct to the consumer. What can the distributor do about this? What advantages \\ncan it offer the manufacturer that the manufacturer is unlikely to be able to reproduce? \\n4. What types of distribution networks are typically best suited for commodity items? \\n5. What type of networks are best suited to highly differentiated products? \\n6. In the future, do you see the value added by distributors decreasing, increasing, or staying \\nabout the same? \\n7. Why has e-business been more successful in the PC industry compared to the grocery indus\\xad\\ntry? In the future, how valuable is e-business likely to be in the PC industry? \\n8. Is e-business likely to be more beneficial in the early part or the mature part of a product's \\nlife cycle? Why? \\n9. Consider the sale of home improvement products at Home Depot or a chain of hardware \\nstores such as Tru-Value. Who can extract the greatest benefit from going online? Why? \\n10. Amazon.com sells books, music, electronics, software, toys, and home improvement products \\nonline. In which product category does e-business offer the greatest advantage compared to\"),\n",

Understand the role of network design in a supply chain. \\n2. Identify factors influencing supply chain network design decisions. \\n3. Develop a framework for making network design decisions. \\n4. Use optimization for facility location and capacity allocation decisions. \\nI\\nn this chapter, we start with the broad supply chain design discussed in Chapter 4 \\nand provide an understanding of the role of network design within a supply chain. \\nAfter assigning the role of each facility as discussed in Chapter 4 and the beginning of \\nthis chapter, we focus on the fundamental questions of facility location, capacity \\nallocation, and market allocation within a supply chain network. We identify and \\ndiscuss the various factors that influence the facility location, capacity, and market \\nallocation decisions. We then establish a framework and discuss various solution \\nmethodologies for network design decisions in a supply chain. \\n5.1 THE ROLE OF NETWORK DESIGN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nSupply chain network design decisions include the assignment of facility role, location \\nof manufacturing, storage, or transportation-related facilities, and the allocation of \\ncapacity and markets to each facility. Supply chain network design decisions are \\nclassified as follows. \\n1. Facility role: What role should each facility play? What processes are performed \\nat each facility? \\n2. Facility location: Where should facilities be located? \\n3. Capacity allocation: How much capacity should be allocated to each facility? \\n4. Market and supply allocation: What markets should each facility serve? Which \\nsupply sources should feed each facility? \\nNetwork design decisions have a significant impact on performance because \\nthey determine the supply chain configuration and set constraints within which the \\nother supply chain drivers can be used either to decrease supply chain cost or to \\nincrease responsiveness. All network design decisions affect each other and must be \\nmade taking this fact into consideration. Decisions concerning the role of each facil\\xad\\nity are significant because they determine the amount of flexibility the supply chain \\nhas in changing the way it meets demand. For example, Toyota has plants located'),\n",

Before 1997, each plant was capable of \\nserving only its local market. This hurt Toyota when the Asian economy went into a \\nrecession in the late 1990s. The local plants in Asia had idle capacity that could not be \\nused to serve other markets that were experiencing excess demand. Toyota has \\nadded flexibility to each plant to be able to serve markets other than the local one. \\nThis additional flexibility helps Toyota deal more effectively with changing global \\nmarket conditions. \\nFacility location decisions have a long-term impact on a supply chain's \\nperformance because it is very expensive to shut down a facility or move it to a \\ndifferent location. A good location decision can help a supply chain be responsive \\nwhile keeping its costs low. Toyota, for example, built its first U.S. assembly plant in \\nLexington, Kentucky, in 1988 and has used the plant since then. The Lexington plant \\nproved very profitable for Toyota when the yen strengthened and cars produced in \\nJapan were too expensive to be cost competitive with cars produced in the United \\nStates. The Lexington plant allowed Toyota to be responsive to the U.S. market while \\nkeeping costs low. \\nIn contrast, a poorly located facility makes it very difficult for a supply chain to \\nperform close to the efficient frontier. For example,Amazon.com found it very difficult \\nto be cost effective in supplying books throughout the United States when it had a \\nsingle warehouse in Seattle. As a result, the company has added warehouses in other \\nparts of the country. \\nCapacity allocation decisions also have a significant impact on supply chain per\\xad\\nformance. Whereas capacity allocation can be altered more easily than location, ca\\xad\\npacity decisions do tend to stay in place for several years. Allocating too much capacity \\nto a location results in poor utilization, and as a result, higher costs. Allocating too little \\ncapacity results in poor responsiveness if demand is not satisfied, or high cost if \\ndemand is filled from a distant facility. \\nThe allocation of supply sources and markets to facilities has a significant impact \\non performance because it affects total production, inventory, and transportation \\ncosts incurred by the supply chain to satisfy customer demand. This decision should \\nbe reconsidered on a regular basis so that the allocation can be changed as market \\nconditions or plant capacities change. Of course, the allocation of markets and supply \\nsources can only be changed if the facilities are flexible enough to serve different \\nmarkets and receive supply from different sources. As we mentioned earlier, \\nAmazon.com has built new warehouses and changed the markets supplied by each \\nwarehouse as its customer base has grown. As a result, it has lowered costs and \\nimproved responsiveness. \\nNetwork design decisions must be revisited as a firm grows or when two \\ncompanies merge. Because of the redundancies and differences in markets served by \\neither of the two separate firms, consolidating some facilities and changing the location \\nand role of others can often help reduce cost and improve responsiveness. \\nWe focus on developing a framework as well as methodologies that can be used for \\nnetwork design in a supply chain. In the next section, we identify various factors that \\ninfluence network design decisions. \\n5.2 FACTORS INFLUENCING NETWORK DESIGN DECISIONS \\nIn this section we examine a wide variety of factors that influence network design \\ndecisions in supply chains.\"),\n",

Firms that focus on cost leadership tend to find the lowest-cost \\nlocation for their manufacturing facilities, even if that means locating very far from the \\nmarkets they serve. For example, in the early 1980s, many apparel producers moved all \\ntheir manufacturing out of the United States to countries with lower labor costs, in hope \\nof lowering costs. With the drop in apparel quotas in 2005, most of the manufacturing is \\nnow moving to low-cost countries such as China. \\nFirms that focus on responsiveness tend to locate facilities closer to the market and \\nmay select a high-cost location if this choice allows the firm to react quickly to \\nchanging market needs. Zara, the Spanish apparel manufacturer, has a large fraction of \\nits production capacity in Portugal and Spain despite the higher cost there. The local \\ncapacity allows the company to respond quickly to changing fashion trends in Europe. \\nIts responsiveness to changing fashion trends has allowed Zara to become one of the \\nfastest-growing apparel retailers in the world. \\nConvenience store chains aim to provide easy access to customers as part of their \\ncompetitive strategy. Convenience store networks thus include many stores that cover an \\narea, with each store being relatively small. In contrast, discount stores such as Sam's \\nClub use a competitive strategy that focuses on providing low prices. Thus, their networks \\nhave very large stores and customers often have to travel many miles to get to one. The \\ngeographic area covered by one Sam's Club store may include dozens of convenience \\nstores. \\nGlobal supply chain networks can best support their strategic objectives with \\nfacilities in different countries playing different roles. For example, Nike has \\nproduction facilities located in many Asian countries. Its facilities in China and \\nIndonesia focus on cost and produce mass-market lower-priced shoes for Nike. In \\ncontrast, facilities in Korea and Taiwan focus on responsiveness and produce higher\\xad\\npriced new designs. This differentiation allows Nike to satisfy a wide variety of \\ndemands in the most profitable manner. \\nIt is important for a firm to identify the mission or strategic role of each facility \\nwhen designing its global network. Kasra Ferdows (1997) suggests the following classifi\\xad\\ncation of possible strategic roles for various facilities in a global supply chain network. \\n1. Offshore facility: low-cost facility for export production. An offshore facility \\nserves the role of being a low-cost supply source for markets located outside the coun\\xad\\ntry where the facility is located. The location selected for an offshore facility should \\nhave low labor and other costs to facilitate low-cost production. Given that many \\nAsian developing countries waive import tariffs if all the output from a factory is \\nexported, they are preferred sites for offshore manufacturing facilities. \\n2. Source facility: low-cost facility for global production. A source facility also has low \\ncost as its primary objective, but its strategic role is broader than that of an offshore \\nfacility. A source facility is often a primary source of product for the entire global net\\xad\\nwork. Source facilities tend to be located in places where production costs are \\nrelatively low, infrastructure is well developed, and a skilled workforce is available. \\nGood offshore facilities migrate over time into source facilities. Many Chinese and \\nIndian apparel manufacturers are attempting to transform into source facilities since \\nthe drop in apparel quotas in 2005. \\n3. Server facility: regional production facility. A server facility's objective is to supply \\nthe market where it is located. A server facility is built because of tax incentives, local \\ncontent requirement, tariff barriers, or high logistics cost to supply the region from\"),\n",

In the late 1970s, Suzuki partnered with the Indian government to set up \\nMaruti Udyog. Initially, Maruti was set up as a server facility and produced cars only \\nfor the Indian market. The Maruti facility allowed Suzuki to overcome the high tariffs \\non imported cars in India. \\n4. Contributor facility: regional production facility with development skills. A contrib\\xad\\nutor facility serves the market where it is located but also assumes responsibility for \\nproduct customization, process improvements, product modifications, or product \\ndevelopment. Most well-managed server facilities become contributor facilities over \\ntime. The Maruti facility in India today develops many new products for both the \\nIndian and the overseas markets and has moved from being a server to a contributor \\nfacility in the Suzuki network. \\n5. Outpost facility: regional production facility built to gain local skills. An outpost \\nfacility is located primarily to obtain access to knowledge or skills that may exist within \\na certain region. Given its location, it also plays the role of a server facility. The primary \\nobjective remains one of being a source of knowledge and skills for the entire network. \\nMany global firms have set up outpost production facilities in Japan despite the high \\noperating costs. \\n6. Lead facility: facility that leads in development and process technologies. A lead \\nfacility creates new products, processes, and technologies for the entire network. Lead \\nfacilities are located in areas with good access to a skilled workforce and technological \\nresources. \\nTECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS \\nCharacteristics of available production technologies have a significant impact on net\\xad\\nwork design decisions. If production technology displays significant economies of \\nscale, a few high-capacity locations are most effective. This is the case in the manufac\\xad\\nture of computer chips, for which factories require a very large investment. As a result, \\nmost semiconductor companies build few high-capacity facilities. \\nIn contrast, if facilities have lower fixed costs, many local facilities are preferred \\nbecause this helps lower transportation costs. For example, bottling plants for Coca\\xad\\nCola do not have a very high fixed cost. To reduce transportation costs, Coca-Cola sets \\nup many bottling plants all over the world, each serving its local market. \\nFlexibility of the production technology affects the degree of consolidation that \\ncan be achieved in the network. If the production technology is very inflexible and \\nproduct requirements vary from one country to another, a firm has to set up local \\nfacilities to serve the market in each country. Conversely, if the technology is flexible, it \\nbecomes easier to consolidate manufacturing in a few large facilities. \\nMACROECONOMIC FACTORS \\nMacroeconomic factors include taxes, tariffs, exchange rates, and other economic \\nfactors that are not internal to an individual firm. As global trade has increased, macro\\xad\\neconomic factors have had a significant influence on the success or failure of supply \\nchain networks. Thus, it is imperative that firms take these factors into account when \\nmaking network design decisions. \\nTariffs and Tax Incentives \\nTariffs refer to any duties that must be paid when products and/or equipment are moved \\nacross international, state, or city boundaries. Tariffs have a strong influence on location \\ndecisions within a supply chain. If a country has very high tariffs, companies either do not'),\n",

High tariffs lead to more production locations within a supply chain network, with \\neach location having a lower allocated capacity. As tariffs have come down with the \\nWorld Trade Organization, and regional agreements such as NAFTA (North America), \\nthe European Union, and MERCOSUR (South America), firms can now supply the \\nmarket within a country from a plant located outside that country without incurring high \\nduties. As a result, firms have begun to consolidate their global production and distribu\\xad\\ntion facilities. For global firms, a decrease in tariffs has led to a decrease in the number of \\nmanufacturing facilities and an increase in the capacity of each facility built. \\nTax incentives are a reduction in tariffs or taxes that countries, states, and cities \\noften provide to encourage firms to locate their facilities in specific areas. Many coun\\xad\\ntries vary incentives from city to city to encourage investments in areas with lower eco\\xad\\nnomic development. Such incentives are often a key factor in the final location decision \\nfor many plants. General Motors built its Saturn facility in Tennessee primarily because \\nof the tax incentives offered by the state. Similarly, BMW built its U.S. factory in \\nSpartanburg, South Carolina, mainly because of the tax incentives offered by that state. \\nDeveloping countries often create free trade zones in which duties and tariffs are \\nrelaxed as long as production is used primarily for export. This creates a strong incen\\xad\\ntive for global firms to set up plants in these countries to be able to exploit their low \\nlabor costs. In China, for example, the establishment of a free trade zone near \\nGuangZhou led to many global firms locating facilities there in the 1990s. \\nA large number of developing countries also provide additional tax incentives \\nbased on training, meals, transportation, and other facilities offered to the workforce. \\nTariffs may also vary based on the product\\'s level of technology. China, for example, \\nwaives tariffs entirely for \"high-tech\" products, in an effort to encourage companies to \\nlocate there and bring in state-of-the-art technology. Motorola located a large chip \\nmanufacturing plant in China to take advantage of the reduced tariffs and other incen\\xad\\ntives available to high-tech products. \\nMany countries also place minimum requirements on local content and limits on \\nimports. Such policies lead companies to set up many facilities and source from local sup\\xad\\npliers. For example, until2004, the United States limited the import of apparel from var\\xad\\nious countries. As a result, companies developed suppliers in many countries to avoid \\nreaching the limit from any one country. The end of quotas in 2005 has led to some con\\xad\\nsolidation of apparel manufacturing in China, India, and a handful of other countries. \\nExchange Rate and Demand Risk \\nFluctuations in exchange rates are common and have a significant impact on the prof\\xad\\nits of any supply chain serying global markets. For example, the dollar fluctuated \\nbetween 102 and 132 yen in the three years from 2002 to 2004. A firm that sells its prod\\xad\\nuct in the United States with production in Japan is exposed to the risk of appreciation \\nof the yen. The cost of production is incurred in yen, whereas revenues are obtained in \\ndollars. Thus, an increase in the value of the yen increases the production cost in dol\\xad\\nlars, decreasing the firm\\'s profits. In the 1980s, many Japanese manufacturers faced this \\nproblem when the yen appreciated in value because most of their production capacity \\nwas located in Japan. The appreciation of the yen decreased their revenues (in terms of \\nyen) from large overseas markets and they saw their profits decline. Most Japanese \\nmanufacturers have responded by building production facilities all over the world. \\nExchange rate risks may be handled using financial instruments that limit, or \\nhedge against, the loss due to fluctuations. Suitably designed supply chain networks, \\nhowever, offer the opportunity to take advantage of exchange-rate fluctuations and \\nincrease profits. An effective way to do this is to build some overcapacity into the'),\n",

This flexibility allows the firm to react to exchange-rate fluctuations by altering \\nproduction flows within the supply chain to maximize profits. \\nCompanies must also take into account fluctuations in demand caused by changes \\nin the economies of different countries. For example, firms with little production flexi\\xad\\nbility experienced unutilized capacity in their Asian plants when Asian economies \\nslowed down between 1996 and 1998. Firms with greater flexibility in their manufac\\xad\\nturing facilities were able to use the extra capacity in their Asian plants to meet the \\nneeds of other countries where demand was high. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, \\nin 1997 Toyota had assembly plants in Asia that were only capable of producing for the \\nlocal market. The Asian financial crisis motivated Toyota to make the plants more flex\\xad\\nible to be able to supply demand from other countries. \\nWhen designing supply chain networks, companies must build appropriate flexibil\\xad\\nity to help counter fluctuations in exchange rates and demand across different countries. \\nPOLITICAL FACTORS \\nThe political stability of the country under consideration plays a significant role in \\nlocation choice. Companies prefer to locate facilities in politically stable countries \\nwhere the rules of commerce and ownership are well defined. Countries with indepen\\xad\\ndent and clear legal systems allow firms to feel that they have recourse in the courts \\nshould they need it. This makes it easier for companies to invest in facilities in these \\ncountries. As with any factor that is hard to quantify, a firm makes a subjective evalua\\xad\\ntion of this factor when designing its supply chain network. \\nINFRASTRUCTURE FACTORS \\nThe availability of good infrastructure is an important prerequisite to locating a facility \\nin a given area. Poor infrastructure adds to the cost of doing business from a given loca\\xad\\ntion.plobal companies have located their factories in China near Shanghai, Tianjin, or \\nGuangZhuo-even though these locations do not have the lowest labor or land costs\\xad\\nbecause there is good infrastructure at these locations. Key infrastructure elements to \\nbe considered during network design include availability of sites, labor availability, \\nproximity to transportation terminals, rail service, proximity to airports and seaports, \\nhighway access, congestion, and local utilities. \\nCOMPETITIVE FACTORS \\nCompanies must consider competitors' strqtegy, size, and location when designing their \\nsupply chain networks. A fundamental decision firms make is whether to locate their \\nfacilities close to competitors or far from them. The form of competition and factors \\nsuch as raw material or labor availability influence this decision. \\n1 • Positive Externalities Between Firms \\nPositive externalities are instances where the collocation of multiple firms benefits all \\nof them. Positive externalities lead to competitors locating close to each other. For \\nexample, gas stations and retail stores tend to locate close to each other because doing \\nso increases the overall demand, thus benefiting all parties. By locating together in a \\nmall, competing retail stores make it more convenient for customers, who need only \\ndrive to one location to find everything they are looking for. This increases the total \\nnumber of customers who visit the mall, increasing demand for all stores located there. \\nAnother example of positive externality is when the presence of a competitor \\nleads to the development of appropriate infrastructure in a developing area.

The company went to considerable effort and built a local supplier network. \\nGiven the well-established supplier base in India, Suzuki's competitors have als.o built \\nassembly plants there, because they now find it more effective to build cars in India \\nrather than import. them to the country. \\nLocating to Split the Market \\nWhen there are no positive externalities, firms locate to be able to capture the largest \\npossible share of the market. A simple model first proposed by Hotelling explains the \\nissues behind this decision.1 \\nWhen firms do not control price but compete on distance from the customer, they \\ncan maximize market share by locating close to each other and splitting the market. \\nConsider a situation in whichcustomers are uniformly located along the line segmen \\nbetween 0 and 1 and two firms compete based on their distance from the customer as \\nshown in Figure 5-l. A customer goes to the closest firm and customers that are \\nequidistant from the two firms are evenly split between them. \\nIf total demand is 1, Firm llocates at point a, and Firm 2locates at point 1 - b, the \\ndemand at the two firms, d1 and d2, is given by \\n1-b-a d1 =a+----2 and d _l+b-a \\n2-\\n2 \\nBoth firms maximize their market share if they move closer to each other and locate at \\na = b = 1/2. \\nObserve that when both firms locate in the middle of the line segment, the average \\ndistance that customers have to travel is 1/4. If one firm locates at 1/4 and the other at \\n3/4, the average distance customers have to travel drops to 1/8. This set of locations, \\nhowever,is not an equilibrium because it gives both firms an incentive to try and \\nincrease market share by moving to the middle. The result of competition is for both \\nfirms to locate close together even though doing so increases the average distance to \\nthe customer. \\nJf the firms compete on price and incur the transportation cost to the customer, it \\nmay be optimal for the two firms to locate as far apart as possible? with Firm !locat\\xad\\ning at 0 and Firm 2locating at 1. Locating far from each other minimizes price compe\\xad\\ntition and helps the firms split the market and maximize profits. \\nCUSTOMER RESPONSE TIME AND LOCAL PRESENCE \\nFirms that target customers who value a short response time must locate close to them. \\nFor example, customers are unlikely to come to a convenience store if they have to \\ntravel a long distance to get there. It is thus best for a convenience store chain to have \\nmany stores distributed in an area so that most people have a convenience store close \\nto them. In contrast, customers shop for larger amounts of goods at supermarkets and \\n1 Jean Tirole, The Theory of Industrial Organization (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1997:279). \\n2Ibid.\"),\n",

Thus, supermarket chains tend to \\nhave stores that are larger than convenience stores and not as densely distributed. \\nMost towns have fewer supermarkets than convenience stores.

Transportation costs decrease as the number of facilities is increased. If the \\nnumber of facilities increases to a point where inbound economies of scale are lost, \\nthen transportation cost increases. For example, with few facilities Amazon.com has \\nlower inventory and facility costs than Borders, which has about 450 stores. Borders, \\nhowever, has lower transportation costs. \\nThe supply chain network design is also influenced by the transformation occur\\xad\\nring at each facility. When there is a significant reduction in material weight or volume \\nas a result of processing, it may be better to locate facilities closer to the supply \\nsource rather than the customer. For example, when iron ore is processed to make \\nsteel, the amount of output is a small fraction of the amount of ore used.

This includes determining the stages in the supply chain, and whether \\neach supply chain function will be performed in-house or outsourced (see Chapter 4). \\nPhase I starts with a clear definition of the firm's competitive strategy as the set of \\ncustomer needs that the supply chain aims to satisfy. The supply chain strategy then \\nspecifies what capabilities the supply chain network must have to support the competi\\xad\\ntive strategy (see Chapter 2). Next, managers must forecast the likely evolution of \\nglobal competition and whether competitors in each market will be local or global play\\xad\\ners. Managers must also identify constraints on available capital and whether growth \\nwill be accomplished by acquiring existing facilities, building new facilities, or partnering. \\n-------------------\"),\n",

Such a forecast must include a measure of the size of the demand as well as a determination of whether the customer requirements are homogenous or variable across different coun\\xadtries. Homogenous requirements favor large consolidated facilities, whereas require\\xadments that vary across countries favor smaller, localized facilities. \\nThe next step is for managers to identify whether economies of scale or scope can play a significant role in reducing costs, given available production technologies. If \\neconomies of scale or scope are significant, it may be better to have a few facilities serving many markets. For example, semiconductor manufacturers such as Advanced Micro Devices have very few plants for their global markets, given the economies of scale in production. If economies of scale or scope are not significant, it may be better for each market to have its own facility. \\nNext, managers must identify demand risk, exchange-rate risk, and political risk associated with different regional markets. They must also identify regional tariffs, any requirements for local production, tax incentives, and any export or import restrictions \\nfor each market. The tax and tariff information is used to identify the best location to extract a major share of the profits. In general, it is best to obtain the major share of profits at the location with the lowest tax rate. \\nManagers must identify competitors in each region and make a case for whether a facility needs to be located close to or far from a competitor's facility. The desired response time for each market and logistics costs at an aggregate level in each region must also be identified. \\nBased on all this information, managers identify the regional facility configuration \\nfor the supply chain network using network design models discussed in the next sec\\xadtion. The regional configuration defines the approximate number of facilities in the network, regions where facilities will be set up, and whether a facility will produce all products for a given market or a few products for all markets in the network. \\nPHASE Ill: SELECT A SET OF DESIRABLE POTENTIAL SITES \\nThe objective of Phase III is to select a set of desirable potential sites within each region where facilities are to be located. Sites should be selected based on an analysis of infrastructure availability to support the desired production methodologies. Hard infrastructure requirements include the availability of suppliers, transportation services, communication, utilities, and warehousing infrastructure. Soft infrastructure require\\xadments include the availability of skilled workforce, workforce turnover, and the com\\xadmunity receptivity to business and industry. \\nPHASE IV: LOCATION CHOICES \\nThe objectiveof Phase IV is to select a precise location and capacity allocation for each facility.

Revenues come from the sale of prod\\xad\\nuct, whereas costs arise from facilities, labor, transportation, material, and inventories. \\nThe profits of the firm are also affected by taxes and tariffs. Ideally, profits after tariffs \\nand taxes should be maximized when designing a supply chain network. \\nA manager must consider many trade-offs during network design. For example, \\nbuilding many facilities to serve local markets reduces transportation cost and provides \\na fast response time, but it increases the facility and inventory costs incurred by the firm. \\nManagers use network designmodels in two different situations. First, these mod\\xad\\nels are used to decide on locations where facilities will be established and the capacity \\nto be assigned to each facility. Managers must make this decision considering a time \\nhorizon over which locations and capacities will not be altered (typically in years). \\nSecond, these models are used to assign current demand to the available facilities and \\nidentify lanes along which product will be transported. Managers must consider this \\ndecision at least on an annual basis as demand, prices, exchange rates, and tariffs \\nchange. In both cases, the goal is to maximize the profit while satisfying customer \\nneeds. The following information ideally is available in making the design decision: \\n• Location of supply sources and markets \\n• Location of potential facility sites \\n• Demand forecast by market \\n• Facility, labor, and material costs by site \\n• Transportation costs between each pair of sites \\n• Inventory costs by site and as a function of quantity \\n• Sale price of product in different regions \\n• Taxes and tariffs \\n• Desired response time and other service factors \\nGiven this information, either gravity models or network optimization models may \\nbe used to design the network. We organize the models according to the phase of the \\nnetwork design framework at which each model is likely to be useful. \\nPHASE II: NETWORK OPTIMIZATION MODELS \\nDuring Phase II of the network design framework (see Figure 5-2), a manager considers \\nregional demand, tariffs, economies of scale, and aggregate factor costs to decide the \\nregions in which facilities are to be located. As an example, consider SunOil, a manufac\\xad\\nturer of petrochemical products with worldwide sales. The Vice President of Supply Chain \\ncan consider several different options to meet demand. One possibility is to set up a facil\\xad\\nity in each region. The advantage of such an approach is that it lowers transportation cost \\nand also helps avoids duties that may be imposed if product is imported from other \\nregions. The disadvantage of this approach is that plants are sized to meet local demand \\nand may not fully exploit economies of scale. An alternative approach is to consolidate \\nplants in just a few regions. This improves economies of scale but increases transportation\"),\n",

During Phase II, the manager must consider these quantifiable trade-offs \\nalong With nonquantifiable factors such as the competitive environment and political risk. \\nNetwork optimization models are useful for managers considering regional config\\xad\\nuration during Phase II. The first step is to collect the data in a form that can be used \\nfor a quantitative model. For SunOil, the Vice President of Supply Chain decides to \\nview the worldwide demand in terms of five regions-North America, South America, \\nEurope, Africa, and Asia. The data collected are shown in Figure 5-3. \\nAnnual demand for each of the five regions is shown in cells B9:F9. Cells B4:F8 \\ncontain the variable production, inventory, and transportation cost (including tariffs \\nand duties) of producing in one region to meet demand in each individual region. For \\nexample, as shown in cell C4, it costs $92,000 (including duties) to produce 1 million \\nunits in North America and sell them in South America. Observe that the data col\\xad\\nlected at this stage are at a fairly aggregate level. \\nThere are fixed as well as variable costs associated with facilities, transportation, \\nand inventories at each facility. Fixed costs are those that are incurred no matter how \\nmuch is produced or shipped from a facility. Variable costs are those that are incurred \\nin proportion to the quantity produced or shipped from a given facility. Facility, trans\\xad\\nportation, and inventory costs generally display economies of scale and the marginal \\ncost decreases as the quantity produced at a facility increases. In the models we con\\xad\\nsider, however, all variable costs grow linearly with the quantity produced or shipped. \\nSunOil is considering two different plant sizes in each location. Low-capacity \\nplants can produce 10 million units a year, whereas high-capacity plants can produce \\n20 million units a year, as shown in cells H4:H8 and J4:J8, respectively. High-capacity \\nplants exhibit some economies of scale and have fixed costs that are less than twice the \\nfixed cost ot'a low-capacity plant, as shown in cells I4:I8. All fixed costs are annualized. \\nThe vice president wants to know what the lowest cost network should look like. To \\nanswer this question, we next discuss the capacitated plant location model, which can \\nbe used in this setting. \\nThe Capacitated Plant Location Model \\nThe capacitated plant location network optimization model requires the following inputs: \\nn = number of potential plant locations/capacity (each level of capacity will \\ncount as a separate location) \\nm = number of markets or demand points \\nDj = annual demand from market j \\nKi = potential capacity of plant i \\nfi = annualized fixed cost of keeping factory i open \\ncij = cost of producing and shipping one unit from factory ito market j (cost \\nincludes production, inventory, transportation, and tariffs)\"),\n",

Management feels that significant benefits will result if the two networks are merged appropriately. TelecomOptic will have five factories from which to serve six markets. Management is debating whether all five factories are needed. They have assigned a supply chain team to study the net\\xadwork for the combined company and identify the plants that should be shut down. The problem of selecting the optimal location and capacity allocation is very simi\\xadlar to the regional configuration problem we have already studied in Phase II. The only difference is that instead of using costs and duties that apply over a region, we now use location-specific costs and duties. The supply chain team thus decides to use the capac\\xaditated plant location model discussed earlier to solve the problem in Phase IV. Ideally, the problem should be formulated to maximize total profits taking into account costs, taxes, and duties by location. Given that taxes and duties do not vary between locations, the supply chain team decides to locate factories and then allocate demand to the open factories to minimize the total cost of facilities, transportation, and inventory.

For much larger problems, there \\nare four ways that an IT system can help with network design relative to the use of a \\ngeneral-purpose tool such as Excel. \\n1. A good network design IT system makes the modeling of the network design problems \\nmuch easier than in a general-purpose tool such as Excel. These applications have many \\nbuilt-in tools that facilitate an accurate description of a large supply chain network and \\nincorporate realistic features that would be time consuming and difficult to build in Excel. \\n2. An IT system contains high-performance optimization technologies, which deliver a \\nhigh-quality solution for large problems in a reasonable amount of time. Although \\nExcel's solver can be upgraded, there are many cases in which the size and complexity \\nof the optimization require a more sophisticated system that a network design applica\\xad\\ntion can provide.\"),\n",

A good network design application also allows for an analysis of various \"what if\" \\nscenarios. Given the uncertainty associated with forecasts, the ability to evaluate net\\xad\\nwork designs in a variety of scenarios is a very powerful tool for a designer. A network \\ndesigner may find it much more appropriate to select a design that gives very good \\ncosts in many likely scenarios rather than a design that is optimal in one scenario but \\nvery poor in another. The ease of modeling and speed of solution allows a good \\nnetwork design application to facilitate what-if analysis to a far greater extent than a \\ngeneral-purpose tool such as Excel. \\n4. Finally, network design applications are structured to interface easily with the plan\\xad\\nning and operational software used by firms, which contain much of the actual data \\nrequired for network design. The ease of interfacing with the data source speeds up the \\ncreation and solution of a network design model. \\nNetwork design applications are often quite inexpensive relative to the other uses \\nof IT we discuss. Network design applications, sometimes called supply chain strategy \\nmodules, are often thrown in for free on top of the much more expensive planning and \\nexecution modules. In fact, many companies have rights to these products without even \\nrealizing it, as a result of past software purchases. \\nThere are some caveats, however, to the use of IT systems in network design. \\nNetwork design decisions are strategic and involve many factors that are hard to quan\\xad\\ntify. When using a network design tool, it is easy to fall into the trap of allowing the \\napplication to make the decision based only on aspects that are quantifiable. Important \\nfactors such as culture, quality-of-life issues, and cost of coordination that are hard for \\nIT to handle can be significant in making a network design decision. Thus, relevant \\nnonquantifiable factors should be included with the output of IT systems when making \\nnetwork design decisions. \\nThe software firms that produce network design software come from three groups \\n(see Chapter 17 for more details). The first are the large enterprise resource planning \\n(ERP) players who now dominate the supply chain software space. The two giants here \\nare SAP and Oracle. There are also several best-of-breed supply chain vendors that \\nhave held on despite the gains of the ERP vendors in recent years. These firms include \\ni2 Technologies and Manugistics. Finally, there is a group of small firms such as Optiant \\nand SmartOps that focus exclusively on network design or supply chain strategy. These \\nfirms are more consultative than a pure software house. \\nIn summary, although network design is an area that is not as closely tied to IT as \\nmany other supply chain areas we discuss, it is nonetheless one that can benefit from \\nthe power ofiT at relatively little cost. \\n5.6 MAKING NETWORK DESIGN DECISIONS IN PRACTICE \\nManagers should keep the following issues in mind when making network design deci\\xad\\nsions for a supply chain. \\nDo not underestimate the life span of facilities. It is important to think through \\nthe long-term consequences of facility decisions because facilities last a long time and \\nhave an enduring impact on a firm\\'s performance. Managers must consider not only \\nfuture demand and costs but also scenarios in which technology may change. \\nOtherwise, facilities may become useless within a few years. For example, an insurance \\ncompany moved its clerical labor from a metropolitan location to a suburban location \\nto lower costs. With increasing automation, the need for clerical labor decreased signif\\xad\\nicantly and within a few years the facility was no longer needed. The company found it'),\n",

Supply chain network designers must consider that any factories that they put \\nin place will stay there for an extended period of a decade or more. Warehouses or \\nstorage facilities, particularly those that are not owned by the company, can be changed \\nwithin a year of making the decision. \\nDo not gloss over the cultural implications. Network design decisions regarding \\nfacility location and facility role have a significant impact on the culture of each facility \\nand the firm. The culture at a facility will be influenced by other facilities in its vicinity. \\nNetwork designers can use this fact to influence the role of the new facility and the \\nfocus of people working there. For example, when Ford Motor Company introduced \\nthe Lincoln Mark VIII model, management was faced with a dilemma. At that time, the \\nMark VIII shared a platform with the Mercury Cougar. However, the Mark VIII is part \\nof Ford\\'s luxury Lincoln division. Locating the Mark VIII line with the Cougar would \\nhave obvious operational advantages because of shared parts and processes. However, \\nFord decided to locate the Mark VIII line in the Wixom, Michigan, plant, where other \\nLincoln cars were produced. The primary reason for doing so was to ensure that the \\nfocus on quality for the Mark VIII would be consistent with that of other Ford luxury \\ncars that were produced in Wixom. \\nThe location of a facility has a significant impact on the extent and form of com\\xad\\nmunication that develops in the supply chain network. Locating a facility far from \\nheadquarters will likely give it more of a culture of autonomy. This may be beneficial if \\nthe firm is starting a new division that needs to function in a manner different from the \\nrest of the company. In contrast, locating two facilities closer together is likely to \\nencourage communication between them. Extensive communication can be very use\\xad\\nful if decisions made at either facility have a strong impact on the performance of the \\nother facility. \\nDo not ignore quality-of-life issues. The quality of life at selected facility locations has \\na significant impact on performance because it influences the workforce available and its \\nmorale. In many instances, a firm may be better off selecting a higher-cost location if it \\nprovides a much better quality of life. Failure to do so can have dire consequences. For \\nexample, an aerospace supplier decided to relocate an entire division to an area with a \\nlower standard of living in order to reduce costs. Most of the marketing team, however, \\nrefused to relocate. As a result, customer relations deteriorated and the company had a \\nvery difficult transition. The effort to save costs hurt the company and effectively cur\\xad\\ntailed the firm\\'s status as a major player in its market.4 \\nFocus on tariffs and tax incentives when locating facilities. Managers making facility \\nlocation decisions should consider tariffs and tax incentives carefully. When consider\\xad\\ning international locations, it is astounding how often tax incentives drive the choice of \\nlocation, often overcoming all of the other cost factors combined. For instance, Ireland \\nhas developed a large high-tech industry by enticing companies with low taxes. Even \\nwithin nations, local governments may offer generous packages of low to no taxes and \\nfree land when firms decide to locate facilities within their jurisdiction. Toyota, BMW, \\nand Mercedes have all chosen their facility locations in the United States due in large \\npart to tax incentives offered by different states. \\n3Charles F.

Understand the role of network design decisions in supply chain. \\nNetwork design decisions include identifying facility roles, locations, and capacities as \\nwell as allocating markets to be served by different facilities. These decisions define the \\nphysical constraints within which the network must be operated as market conditions \\nchange. Good network design decisions increase supply chain profits, whereas poor network \\ndesign hurts profits. \\n2. Identify factors influencing supply chain network design decisions. \\nBroadly speaking, network design decisions are influenced by strategic, technological, \\nmacroeconomic, political, infrastructure, competitive, and operational factors. \\n3. Develop a framework for making network design decisions. \\nThe goal of network design is to maximize the supply chain's long-term profitability. \\nThe process starts by defining the supply chain strategy, which must be aligned with the com\\xad\\npetitive strategy of the firm. The supply chain strategy, regional demand, costs, infrastruc\\xad\\nture, and the competitive environment are used to define a regional facility configuration. \\nFor regions where facilities are to be located, potentially attractive sites are then selected \\nbased on available infrastructure. The optimal configuration is determined from the poten\\xad\\ntial sites using demand, logistics cost, factor costs, and margins in different markets. \\n4. Use optimization for facility location and capacity allocation decisions. \\nGravity location models identify a location that minimizes inbound and outbound trans\\xad\\nportation costs. They are simple to implement but do not account for other important costs. \\nNetwork optimization models can include contribution margins, taxes, tariffs, production, trans\\xad\\nportation, and inventory costs and are used to maximize profitability. These models are useful \\nwhen locating facilities, allocating capacity to facilities, and allocating markets to facilities. \\nDiscussion Questions \\nExercises \\n1. How do the location and size of warehouses affect the performance of a firm such as \\nAmazon. com? What factors should Amazon. com take into account when making this decision? \\n2. How do import duties and exchange rates affect the location decision in a supply chain? \\n3. What are different roles played by production facilities within a global network? \\n4. Amazon.com has built new warehouses as it has grown. How does this change affect various \\ncost and response times in the Amazon.com supply chain? \\n5. McMaster-Carr sells maintenance, repair, and operations equipment from five warehouses \\nin the U~ited States. W.W. Grainger sells products from more than 350 retail locations, sup\\xad\\nported by several warehouses. In both cases, customers place orders using the Web or on the \\nphone. Discuss the pros and cons of the two strategies. \\n6. Consider a firm such as Dell, with very few production facilities worldwide. List the pros and \\ncons of this approach and why it may or may not be suitable for the computer industry. \\n7. Consider a firm such as Ford, with more than 150 facilities worldwide. List the pros and cons \\nof having many facilities and why it may or may not be suitable for the automobile industry. \\n1. SC Consulting, a supply chain consulting firm, must decide on the location of its home \\noffices. Its clients are located primarily in the 16 states listed in Table 5-5. There are four \\npotential sites for home offices: Los Angeles, Tulsa, Denver, and Seattle, The annual fixed \\ncost of locating an office in Los Angeles is $165,428, Tulsa is $131,230, Denver is $140,000, \\nand Seattle is $145,000. The expected number of trips to each state and the travel costs from \\neach potential site are shown in Table 5-5.\"),\n",

StayFresh, a manufacturer of refrigerators in India, has two plants-one in Mumbai and the other in Chennai. Each plant has a capacity of 300,000 units. The two plants serve the entire country, which is divided into four regional markets: the North, with a demand of 100,000 units; the West, with a demand of 150,000 units; the South, with a demand of 150,000 units; and the East, with a demand of 50,000 units. Two other potential sites for plants include Delhi and Kolkata. The variable production and transport costs (in thousands of rupees; 1 U.S. dollar is worth about 45 rupees) per refrigerator from each potential production site to each market are as shown in Table 5.12. \\nStayFresh is anticipating a compounded growth in demand of 20 percent per year for the next five years and must plan its network investment decisions. Demand is anticipated to stabilize after five years of growth. Capacity can be added in increments of either 150,000 or 300,000 units. Adding 150,000 units of capacity incurs a one-time cost of 2 billion rupees, whereas adding 300,000 units of capacity incurs a one-time cost of 3.4 billion rupees. Assume that StayFresh plans to meet all demand (prices are sufficiently high) and that capacity for each year must be in place by the beginning of the year. Also assume that the cost for the fifth year will continue for the next 10 years, that is, years 6 to 15. The problem can now be solved for different discount factors. To begin with, assume a discount factor of 0.2, that is, 1 rupee spent next year is worth 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 rupee this year. \\n(a) How should the production network for the company evolve over the next five years? (b) How does your answer change if the anticipated growth is 15 percent? 25 percent? (c) How does your decision change for a discount factor of 0.25? 0.15?

Demand had grown by 80 per\\xad\\ncent. This growth, however, was a mixed blessing. The \\nventure capitalists supporting the company were very \\npleased with the growth in sales and the resulting \\nincrease -in revenue. Sanjay and his team, however, could \\nclearly see that costs would grow faster than revenues if \\ndemand continued to grow and the supply chain network \\nwas not redesigned. They decided to analyze the perfor\\xad\\nmance of the current network to see how it could be \\nredesigned to best cope with the rapid growth anticipated \\nover the next three years. \\nSPORTSTUFF.COM \\nSanjay Gupta founded SportStuff.com in 1996 with a mis\\xad\\nsion of supplying parents with more affordable sports \\nequipment for their children. Parents complained about \\nhaving to discard expensive skates, skis, jackets, and shoes \\nbecause children outgrew them rapidly. Sanjay's initial \\n·.~plan was for the company to purchase used equipment \\nand jackets from families and any surplus equipment \\nfrom manufacturers and retailers and sell these over the \\nInternet. The idea was very well received in the market\\xad\\nplace, demand grew rapidly, and by the end of 1996, the \\ncompany had sales of $0.8 million. By this time a variety \\nof new and used products were being sold and the com\\xad\\npany received significant venture capital support. \\nIn June 1996, Sanjay leased part of a warehouse in \\nthe outskirts of St. Louis to manage the large amount \\nZone Demand in 1999 \\nNorthwest 320,000 \\nSouthwest 200,000 \\nUpper Midwest 160,000 \\nSmall Warehouse \\nof product being sold. Suppliers sent their product to \\nthe warehouse. Customer orders were packed and shipped \\nby UPS from there. As demand grew, SportStuff.com \\nleased more space within the warehouse. By 1999, \\nSportStuff.com leased the entire warehouse and orders \\nwere being shipped to customers all over the United \\nStates. Management divided the United States into six \\ncustomer zones for planning purposes. Demand from \\neach customer zone in 1999 was as shown in Table 5-15. \\nSanjay estimated that the next three years would see a \\ngrowth rate of about 80 percent per year, after which \\ndemand would level off. \\nTHE NETWORK OPTIONS \\nSanja.y and his management team could see that they \\nneeded more warehouse space to cope with the anticipated \\ngrowth. One option was to lease more warehouse space in \\nSt. Louis itself Other options included leasing warehouses \\nall over the country. Leasing a warehouse involved fixed \\ncosts based on the size of the warehouse and variable costs \\nthat varied with the quantity shipped through the ware\\xad\\nhouse. Four potential locations for warehouses were identi\\xad\\nfied in Denver, Seattle, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. Ware\\xad\\nhouses leased could be either small (about 100,000 sq. ft.) \\nor large (200,000 sq: ft.). Small warehouses could handle a \\nflow of up to 2 milliOI;J. units per year, whereas large ware\\xad\\nhouses could handle a flow of up to 4 million units per year. \\nThe current warehouse in St. Louis was small.

Identify uncertainties that influence supply chain performance and network design. \\n2. Understand the methodologies used to evaluate supply chain design decisions under \\nuncertainty. \\n3. Analyze supply chain network design decisions in an uncertain environment. \\nI\\nn previous chapters, we emphasized that network design decisions have a long-term \\nimpact on a supply chain\\'s performance. As a result, managers must account for \\ndemand, macroeconomic, and financial uncertainties over the long term when design\\xad\\ning a supply chain network. In this chapter, we discuss the methodologies used to eval\\xad\\nuate network design decisions under uncertainty and show how they improve supply \\nchain decisions. \\n6.1 THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTY ON NETWORK DESIGN \\nSupply chain design decisions such as the number and size of plants to build, the size \\nand scope of a distribution system, and whether to buy or lease one\\'s facilities involve \\nsignificant investment. These decisions, once made, cannot be altered in the short term. \\nThey remain in place for several years and define the constraints within which the sup\\xad\\nply chain must compete. Thus, it is important that these decisions be evaluated as accu\\xad\\nrately as possible. \\nOver the life of a supply chain network, a company experiences fluctuations in \\ndemand, prices, exchange rates, and the competitive environment. A decision that \\nlooks very good under the current environment may be quite poor if the situation \\nchanges. For example, long-term contracts for warehousing are more attractive if the \\ndemand and price of warehousing do not change in the future or if the price of ware\\xad\\nhousing goes up. In contrast, a short-term contract is more attractive if either demand \\nor the price of warehousing drops in the future. The degree of demand and price uncer\\xad\\ntainty has a significant influence on the appropriate portfolio of long-and short-term \\nwarehousing space that a firm should carry. \\nUncertainty of demand and price drives the value of building flexible production \\ncapacity at a plant. If price and demand do vary over time in a global network, flexible \\nproduction capacity can be reconfigured to maximize,profits in the new environment. \\nIn the late 1990s, Toyota made its global assembly plants more flexible so that each \\nplant could supply multiple markets. One of the main benefits of this flexibility is that'),\n",

A firm may choose to build a flexible global \\nsupply chain even in the presence of little demand or supply uncertainty if uncertainty \\nexists in exchange rates or prices. Thus, supply, demand, and financial uncertainty must \\nbe considered when making network design decisions. \\nIn the next section we discuss a methodology for evaluating any supply chain deci\\xad\\nsion that will be in place for an extended duration. \\nDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS \\nSupply chain design decisions should be evaluated as a sequence of cash flows over the \\nduration of time that they will be in place. The present value of a stream of cash flows \\nis what that stream is worth in today\\'s dollars. Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis \\nevaluates the present value of any stream of future cash flows and allows management \\nto compare two streams of cash flows in terms of their financial value. DCF analysis is \\nbased on the fundamental premise that \"a dollar today is worth more than a dollar \\ntomorrow\" because a dollar today may be invested and earn a return in addition to the \\ndollar invested. This premise provides the basic tool for comparing the relative value of \\nfuture cash flows that will arrive during different time periods. \\nThe present value of future cash flow is found by using a discount factor. If a dollar \\ntoday can be invested and earn a Iat£ gf retlJlll k over the next period, an investment of+ }:: \\n$1 today will result in 1 + k dollars in the next period. An investor will therefore be ·· \\nindifferent between obtaining $1 in the next period or $11(1 + k) in the current period. \\nThus, $1 in the next period is discounted by the \\n. 1 Discount factor = 1 + k (6.1) \\nto obtain its present value. \\nThe rate of return k is also referred to as the discount rate, hurdle rate, or oppor\\xad\\ntunity cost of capital. Given a stream of cash flows Co, C1, ... , CT over the next T peri\\xad\\nods, and a rate of return k, the net present value (NPV) of this cash flow stream is \\ngiven by \\nNPV = C 0 + ~ ( 1 ~ k y Ct (6.2) \\nThe NPV of different options should be compared when making supply chain \\ndecisions. A negative NPV for an option indicates that the option will lose money for \\nthe supply chain. The decision with the highest NPV provides a supply chain with the \\nhighest financial return. \\nConsider Trips Logistics, a third-party logistics firm that provides warehousing and \\nother logistics services. The general manager at Trips Logistics must decide the amount \\nof space to lease for the upcoming three-year period. He has forecast that Trips \\nLogistics will need to handle a demand of 100,000 units for each of the three years. \\nHistorically, Trips Logistics has required 1,000 sq. ft. of warehouse space for every 1,000 \\nunits of demand. For the purposes of this discussion, the only cost Trips Logistics faces \\nis the cost for the warehouse. \\nTrips Logistics receives revenue of $1.22 for each unit of demand. The general \\nmanager must decide whether to sign a three-year lease or obtain warehousing space \\non the spot market each y_ear. The three-year lease costs $1 per square foot per year'),\n",

In reality, demand and prices are highly uncertain and are likely to \\nfluctuate during the life of any supply chain decision. For a global supply chain, \\nexchange rates and inflation are also likely to vary over time in differen_t locations. \\nSupply chain managers must incorporate these uncertainties when making network \\ndesign decisions. Next we discuss some models that can be used to represent uncer\\xad\\ntainty in factors such as demand, price, and exchange rate. \\nBINOMIAL REPRESENTATION OF UNCERTAINTY \\nThe binomial representation of uncertainty is based on the assumption that when mov\\xad\\ning from one period to the next, the value of the underlying factor (such as demand or \\n- ··------'),\n",

In the commonly used multiplica\\xad\\ntive binomial, it is assumed that the underlying factor either moves up by a factor u > 1 \\nwith probability p, or down by a factor d < 1 with probability 1 - p. Given a price Pin \\nPeriod 0, the possible outcomes in future periods are as follows: \\nPeriod 1: Pu, Pd \\nPeriod 2: Pu 2, Pud, Pd 2 \\nPeriod 3: Pu 3 , Pu 2d, Pud 2 , Pd 3 \\nPeriod 4: Pu 4, Pu 3d, Pu 2d2, Pud 3, Pd 4 \\nIn general, Period T has all possible outcomes Pu 1d(T-t), fort = 0, 1, ... , T. From a state \\nPuad(T-a) in Period t, the price may move to either Pua+ld(T-a) with probability p or \\nPuad(T-a)+l with probability (1-p) in Period t + 1. This is represented as the binomial \\ntree shown in Figure 6-1. \\nIn the additive binomial, it is assumed that the underlying factor increases by u in \\na given period with probability p and decreases by d with probability 1 - p. The addi\\xad\\ntive binomial has the following states in a given period: \\nPeriod 1:P + u,P-d \\nPeriod 2: P + 2u, P + u - d, P - 2d \\nPeriod 3: P + 3u, P + 2u - d, P + u - 2d, P - 3d \\nPeriod 4: P + 4u, P + 3u - d, P + 2u - 2d, P + u - 3d, P - 4d \\nIn general, Period T has all possible outcomes P + tu - (T- t)d, fort = 0, 1, ... , T. \\nThe multiplicative binomial cannot take on negative values and can be used for \\nfactors such as demand, price, and exchange rates that cannot become negative. It also \\nhas the advantage of the growth or decline in the given factor being proportional to the \\ncurrent value of the factor. For example, a product with a unit price of $10 is much less \\nlikely to see a fluctuation in price of $5 than a product with a unit price of $100. This \\nfact is better captured by the multiplicative binomial.'),\n",

Certainly a price can change to more than just two values. But by making the \\nperiod short enough, this assumption may be justified. The time period selected \\ndepends on the factor under consideration and the frequency with which decision \\nmaking occurs. For example, if a decision is made monthly, the time period should be \\nno longer than a month. A time period that is shorter than a month may be justified to \\nallow more than two outcomes at the end of each month. \\nAs the number of periods increases, the probability distribution among the end \\nstates of the multiplicative binomial becomes smoother and begins to resemble the \\nnormal distribution. Observe that as we go further into the future, the range of possi\\xad\\nble outcomes increases. This is a common property of all binomial distributions and \\nis a reasonable assumption for many factors such as demand, price, or exchange \\nrates. \\nOTHER REPRESENTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY \\nIn the valuation of options, the underlying asset price is often allowed to vary continu\\xad\\nously over time. A commonly used process to describe the evolution of the asset price \\nis the log-normal diffusion process. A key feature of this process is that the price never \\ndrops below zero. Another feature of the log-normal diffusion process that is similar to \\nthe binomial is that the variance of the asset price grows with time. In fact, the variance \\ngrows proportionally to the length of the time horizon. \\nAnother common representation of the evolution of a financial factor is the mean \\nreverting process. The idea here is that the factor fluctuates around a mean and experi\\xad\\nences shocks. When the factor deviates, it is pulled back toward the mean over time. \\nThe farther from the mean that the factor strays, the stronger it is pulled back toward \\nthe mean. \\n6.4 EVALUATING NETWORK DESIGN DECISIONS \\nUSING DECISION TREES \\nA manager makes several different decisions when designing a supply chain network. \\nFor instance: \\n• Should the firm sign a long-term contract for warehousing space or get space \\nfrom the spot market as needed? \\n• What should the firm's mix of long-term and spot market be in the portfolio \\nof transportation capacity? \\n• How much capacity should various facilities have? What fraction of this capacity \\nshould be flexible? \\nIf uncertainty is ignored, a manager will always sign long-term contracts (because \\nthey are typically cheaper) and avoid all flexible capacity (because it is more expen\\xad\\nsive). Such decisions, however, can hurt the firm if future demand or prices are not as \\nforecast at the time of the decision. \\nFor example, until around 1990, all production capacity in the pharmaceutical \\nindustry was dedicated. Dedicated capacity was cheaper than flexible capacity but \\ncould only be used for the drug it was designed for: Pharmaceutical companies, how\\xad\\never, have found it very difficult to forecast the demand and price for drugs in the mar\\xad\\nketplace. Thus, a large fraction of the dedicated capacity can go unused if the forecast\"),\n",

Today, pharmaceutical companies have a strategy of carrying a portfolio of dedicated and flexible capacity. Most products are introduced in a flexible facility and are moved to a dedicated facility only when a reasonably accu\\xadrate forecast of future demand is available. \\nDuring network design, managers thus need a methodology that allows them to estimate the uncertainty in their forecast of demand and price and then incorporate this uncertainty in the decision-making process. Such a methodology is most impor\\xadtant for network design decisions because these decisions are hard to change in the short term. In this section we describe such a methodology and show that account\\xading for uncertainty can have a significant impact on the value of network design decisions. \\nA decision tree is a graphic device used to evaluate decisions under uncertainty. Decision trees with DCFs can be used to evaluate supply chain design decisions given uncertainty in prices, demand, exchange rates, and inflation. The first step in setting up a decision tree is to identify the number of time peri\\xadods into the future that will be considered when making the decision. The decision maker should also identify the duration of a period-which could be a day, a month, a quarter, or any other time period. The duration of a period should be the minimum period of time over which factors affecting supply chain decisions may change by a significant amount. \"Significant\" is hard to define, but in most cases it is appropriate to use the duration over which an aggregate plan holds as a period. If planning is done monthly, we set the duration of a period at a month. In the following discussion, Twill represent the number of time periods over which the supply chain decision is to be evaluated. \\nThe next step is to identify factors that will affect the value of the decision and are likely to fluctuate over the next T periods. These factors include demand, price, exchange rate, and inflation, among others. Having identified the key factors, the next step is to identify probability distributions that define the fluctuation of each factor from one period to the next. If, for instance, demand and price are identified as the two key factors that affect the decision, the probability of moving from a given value of demand and price in one period to any other value of demand and price in the next period must be defined. \\nThe next step is to identify a periodic discount rate k to be applied to future cash flows. It is not essential that the same discount rate apply to each period or even at every node in a period. The discount rate should take into account the inherent risk associated with the investment. In general, a higher discount rate should apply to investments with higher risk. \\nThe decision is now evaluated using a decision tree, which contains the present and T future periods. Within each period a node must be defined for every possible combi\\xadnation of factor values (say, demand and price) that can be achieved. Arrows are drawn from origin nodes in Period ito end nodes in Period i + 1. The probability on an arrow is referred to as the transition probability and is the probability of transitioning from the origin node in Period i to the end node in Period i + 1. The decision tree is evaluated starting from nodes in Period T and working back to Period 0. For each node, the decision is optimized taking into account current and future values of various factors. The analysis is based on Bellman\\'s principle, which states that for any choice of strategy in a given state, the optimal strategy in the next period is the one that is selected if the entire analysis is assumed to begin in the next period. This principle allows the optimal strategy to be solved\\' in a backward fashion starting at the last period. Expected future cash flows are discounted back and included in the decision currently under consideration. The value of the node in'),\n",

Tools such as Treeplan are available that help solve decision trees on \\nspreadsheets. \\nThe decision tree analysis methodology is summarized as follows: \\n1. Identify the duration of each period (month, quarter, etc.) and the number of peri\\xad\\nods T over which the decision is to be evaluated. \\n2. Identify factors such as demand, price, and exchange rate whose fluctuation will be \\nconsidered over the next T periods. \\n3. Identify representations of uncertainty for each factor; that is, determine what dis\\xad\\ntribution to use to model the uncertainty. \\n4. Identify the periodic discount rate k for each period. \\n5. Represent the decision tree with defined states in each period as well as the transi\\xad\\ntion probabilities between states in successive periods. \\n6. Starting at period T, work back to Period 0 identifying the optimal decision and \\nthe expected cash flows at each step. Expected cash flows at each state in a given \\nperiod should be discounted back when included in the previous period. \\nWe illustrate the decision tree analysis methodology by using the lease decision \\nfacing the general manager at Trips Logistics. The manager must decide whether to \\nlease warehouse space for the coming three years and the quantity to lease. The long\\xad\\nterm lease is currently cheaper than the spot market rate for warehouse space. The \\nmanager anticipates uncertainty in demand and spot prices for warehouse space over \\nthe corning three years. The long-term lease is cheaper but could go unused if demand \\nis lower than anticipated. The long-term lease may also end up being more expensive if \\nfuture spot market prices come down. In contrast, spot market rates are high and \\nwarehouse space from the spot market will be expensive if future demand is high. The \\nmanager is considering three options: \\n1. Get all warehousing space from the spot market as needed. \\n2. Sign a three-year lease for a fixed amount of warehouse space and get additional \\nrequirements from the spot market. \\n3. Sign a flexible lease with a minimum charge that allows variable usage of ware\\xad\\nhouse space up to a limit with additional requirement from the spot market. \\nWe now discuss how the manager can make the appropri_ate decision, taking \\nuncertainty into account. \\nOne thousand square feet of warehouse space is required for every 1,000 units of \\ndemand, and the current demand at Trips Logistics is for 100,000 units per year. The \\nmanager decides to use a multiplicative binomial representation of uncertainty for \\nboth demand and price. From one year to the next, demand may go up by 20 percent \\nwith a probability of 0.5 or go down by 20 percent with a probability of 0.5. The proba\\xad\\nbilities of the two outcomes are unchanged from one year to the next. \\nThe general manager can sign a three-year lease at a price of $1 per square foot \\nper year. Warehouse space is currently available on the spot market for $1.20 per \\nsquare foot per year. From one year to the next, spot prices for warehouse space may \\ngo up by 10 percent with probability 0.5 or go down by 10 percent with probability 0.5 \\naccording to a binomial process. The probabilities of the two outcomes are unchanged \\nfrom one year to the next. \\nThe general manager feels that prices of warehouse space and demand for the \\nproduct fluctuate independently. Each unit Trips Logistics handles results in revenue of \\n$1.22 and Trips Logistics is committed to handling all demand that arises. Trips \\nLogistics uses a discount rate of k = 0.1 for each of the three years. \\n---~-- ~·--- --- ----------------~----------------\\n- ---------~----------------------'),\n",

AM tires faces a plant location decision in a global net\\xad\\nwork with fluctuating exchange rates and demand uncertainty. . \\nAM Tires sells its products in both Mexico and the United States. Demand in the \\nUnited States is currently 100,000 tires per year, and that in Mexico is 50,000 tires per \\nyear. From one year to the next, demand in either country may increase by 20 percent \\nwith probability 0.5 or decrease by 20 percent with probability 0.5. Demand fluctua\\xad\\ntions in the two countries are independent. \\nA tire sells for $30 in the United States and 240 pesos in Mexico. The current \\nexchange rate is $1 US = 9 pesos. Exchange rates are expected to fluctuate according \\nto the binomial distribution. From one year to the next, the peso may rise 25 percent or \\ndrop 25 percent, each with a probability of 0.5. Exchange-rate fluctuations are inde\\xad\\npendent of demand fluctuations. \\nAM Tires is designing its manufacturing network, which will be in place for two \\nyears. The company is planning to build a 100,000-unit plant in the United States and a \\n50,000-unit plant in Mexico. The plants may be dedicated, in which case they can only \\nsupply the local market, or flexible, in which case they can supply either market. The \\nfixed and variable costs for each option are shown in Table 6-8. \\nObserve that the fixed costs are given per year rather than up front with a future sal\\xad\\nvage value. Transportation costs between the United States and Mexico are $1 per tire \\n·--------------'-----·\"),\n",

Demand is in thousands and is represented by D U for the United States and D M for Mexico. The exchange rate is represented by E, where E is the number of pesos to a US$. \\nThere are four possible capacity and flexibility combinations between plants in Mexico and the United States. The vice president at AM Tires first evaluates the case in which a dedicated capacity of 100,000 is installed in the United States and a dedicated capacity of 50,000 is installed in Mexico. \\nDEDICATED CAPACITY OF 100,000 IN THE UNITED STATES AND 50,000 IN MEXICO \\nThe vice president starts by evaluating profits at each node in Period 2. Each node is represented by the corresponding value of DU, DM, and E. At each node, given the demand in each market, the existing exchange rate, and the degree of flexibility, demand is allocated between plants to maximize profits (see Chapter 5). \\nPeriod 2 Evaluation \\nThe detailed analysis for the node DU = 144, DM = 72, E = 14.06 is as follows. All 100,000 of the U.S. capacity and all 50,000 of the Mexican capacity is used for the local markets because capacity is dedicated and demand exceeds capacity in both markets. Revenues and costs are evaluated as follows. \\n1. Revenues for DU = 144, DM = 72, E = 14.06. The revenues in the United States and Mexico are evaluated as follows: \\nU.S. revenue from manufacture and sale of 100,000 tires \\n= 100,000 X $30 = $3,000,000 \\nMexico revenue from manufacture and sale of 50,000 tires = 50,000 X 240 \\n= 12,000,000 pesos = $12,000,000/ E = 12,000,000/14.06 = $853,485 \\nTotal revenue = $3,853,485 \\n2. Costs for DU = 144, DM = 72, E = 14.06. The costs in the United States and Mexico are evaluated from the data in Table 6-8. They are \\nFixed cost of U.S. plant = $1,000,000 \\nVariable production cost at U.S. plant = 100,000 X 15 = $1,500,000 \\nFixed cost of Mexico plant = 4,000,000 pesos = $4,000,000/ E \\n= 4,000,000/14.06 = $284,495 \\nVariable production cost at Mexico plant \\n= 50,000 X 110 = 5,500,000 pesos = $5,500,000/ E \\n= 5,500,000/14.06 = $391,181 \\nTotal cost = 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 284,495 + 391,181 = $3,175,676 \\nThe total profit for AM Tires at the node DU = 144,DM = 72,E = 14.06,is thus given by \\nP(DU = 144,DM = 72,E = 14.06,2) = 3,853,485-3,175,676 = $677,809 \\nUsing the same approach, the vice president evaluates the profit in each of the 27 states in Period 2 as shown in Table 6-9. Each state in Perio,d 2 is represented by the corre\\xadsponding value of DU, DM, and E. The amount produced in each plant is the minimum of plant capacity and local demand because both plants are assumed to be dedicated.'),\n",

Flexible capacity may be used to produce tires for either \\ncountry, depending on the profit from doing so. The decision tree in this case is as in \\nFigure 6-3, but the profit at each node changes.

The vice president first evaluates the margin contribution of producing a tire in \\none place and selling in each of the two markets as shown in Table 6-11. \\nFrom Table 6-11 it is clear that, under the given conditions, both U.S. and Mexican \\nproduction should first be used to satisfy U.S. demand of 144,000. The remaining 6,000 \\ntires are sold in the Mexican market because this action maximizes profits for AM \\nTires. The example considered here is simple enough for the optimal demand alloca\\xad\\ntion to be obtained by observation. In general, a demand allocation model (see \\nChapter 5) must be solved at each node of the decision tree. \\n1. U.S. production contribution for DU = 144, DM = 72, E = 14.06. Given a \\ndemand in the United States of 144,000 units, all100,000 units of U.S. production are \\nsent to the local market. Given a margin of $15 per unit, the vice president obtains \\nContribution margin from U.S. production = 100,000 X $15 = $1,500,000 \\nFixed cost of U.S. plant = $1,100,000 \\nProfit from U.S. production = $400,000 \\n2. Mexican production contribution for DU = 144, DM = 72, E = 14.06. Given that \\nthere is a higher margin of $21.2 per tire from selling Mexican tires in the United \\nStates, 44,000 tires from Mexico are sent to the United States. The remaining 6,000 \\ntires are sold in Mexico, with each tire contributing $9.20. Thus \\nContribution margin from Mexican production \\n= 44,000 X $21.2 + 6,000 X $9.2 = $988,000 \\nFixed cost of Mexican plant = 4,200,000 pesos = $298,720 \\nProfit from Mexican production = $689,280 \\nThe total profit for AM Tires is the sum of the profit from U.S. and Mexican production \\nand is given by \\nP(DU = 144, DM = 72, E = 14.06, 2) = $400,000 + $675,055 = $1,089,280 \\nCompare the profit at this node with and without flexibility.

For example, contamination at one of the two suppli\\xad\\ners of flu vaccine to the United States led to a severe shortage at the beginning of the \\n2004 flu season. This shortage led to rationing in most states and severe price gouging \\nin some cases. Similarly, the significant strengthening of the euro has hurt firms that \\nhave most of their supply sources located in Western Europe. Table 6-17 contains a \\ncategorization of supply chain risks and their drivers that must be considered during \\nnetwork design. \\nGood network design can play a significant role in mitigating supply chain risk. For \\ninstance, having multiple suppliers mitigates the risk of disruption from any one supply \\nsource.Anexcellent example is the difference in impact on Nokia and Ericsson when a \\nplant owned by Royal Phillips Electronics, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, \\ncaught fire in March 2000. Nokia adjusted to the disruption quickly using ~everal other \\nsupply plants in its network. In contrast, Ericsson had no backup source in its network \\nand was unable to react. Ericsson estimated that it lost revenues of $400 million as a \\nresult. Similarly, having flexible capacity mitigates the risks of global demand, price, \\nand exchange-rate fluctuations. For example, Hino Trucks uses flexible capacity at its \\nplants to change production levels for different products by shifting workforce \\nbetween lines. As a result, the company keeps a constant workforce in the plant even \\nthough the production at each line varies to best match supply and demand.

Combine strategic planning and financial planning during network design. In most \\norganizations, financial planning and strategic planning are performed independently. \\nStrategic planning tries to prepare for future uncertainties but often without rigorous \\nquantitative analysis, whereas financial planning performs quantitative analysis but \\nassumes a predictable or well-defined future. This chapter presents methodologies that \\nallow integration of financial and strategic planning. Decision makers should design \\nsupply chain networks considering a portfolio of strategic options--the option to wait, \\nbuild excess capacity, build flexible capacity, sign long-term contracts, purchase from \\nthe spot market, and so forth. The various options should be evaluated in the context of \\nfuture uncertainty. \\n2. Use multiple metrics to evaluate supply chain networks. As one metric can give only \\npart of the picture, it is beneficial to examine network design decisions using multiple \\nmetrics such as firm profits, supply chain profits, customer service levels, and response \\ntimes. Good decisions perform well along most relevant metrics.'),\n",

Use financial analysis as an input to decision making, not as the decision-making \\nprocess. Financial analysis is a great tool in the decision-making process, as it often \\nproduces an answer and an abundance of quantitative data to back up that answer. \\nHowever, financial methodologies alone do not provide a complete picture of the \\nalternatives, and other nonquantifiable inputs should also be considered. \\n4. Use estimates along with sensitivity analysis. Many of the inputs into financial analy\\xad\\nsis are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain accurately. This can cause financial analysis \\nto be a long and drawn-out process. One of the best ways to speed the process along \\nand arrive at a good decision is to use estimates of inputs when it appears that finding \\na very accurate input would take an inordinate amount of time. As we discuss in some \\nof the other practice-oriented sections, using estimates is fine when the estimates are \\nbacked up by sensitivity analysis. It is almost always easier to come up with a range for \\nan input than it is to come up with a single point. By performing sensitivity analysis on \\nthe input's range, managers can often show that no matter where the true input lies \\nwithin the range, the decision remains the same. When this is not the case, they have \\nhighlighted a key variable to making the decision and it likely deserves more attention \\nto arrive at a more accurate answer. In summary, to make supply chain design decisions \\neffectively, managers need to make estimates of inputs and then test all recommenda\\xad\\ntions with sensitivity analysis. \\n6.8 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Identify uncertainties that influence supply chain performance and network design. \\nThe main financial measurement for evaluating supply chain alternatives is the present \\nvalue of the stream of cash flows generated by each alternative. These streams are affected \\nby uncertainty of demand, price, exchange rates, and other economic factors. These uncer\\xad\\ntainties and any flexibility in the supply chain network must be taken into account when \\nvaluing the cash flows. \\n· 2. Understand the methodologies used to evaluate supply chain decisions under uncertainty. \\nWhen valuing the streams of cash flows, decision trees are a basic approach to valuing \\nalternatives under uncertainty. Incorporating a binomial representation of uncertainty \\nallows the decision tree to value alternatives given uncertainty. When decision trees become \\ntoo complex to solve reasonably, simulation can be used to perform financial evaluations on \\nthe decision alternatives. \\n3. Analyze supply chain network design decisions in an uncertain environment. \\nThe basic steps in analyzing network design decisions involve gathering financial data \\non the alternatives, determining what the uncertainties affecting the decision are, quantify\\xad\\ning the cash flows for each alternative in each time period, quantifying the uncertainties' \\nimpact on the cash flows, and using one of the methodologies to calculate a financial valua\\xad\\ntion for the different alternatives. \\nDiscussion Questions \\n1. Why is it important to consider uncertainty when evaluating supply chain design decisions? \\n2. What are the major sources of uncertainty that can affect the value of supply chain decisions? \\n3. Describe the basic principle of DCFs and how it can be used to compare different streams \\nof cash flows. \\n4. How does the binomial representation of uncertainty relate to the normal distribution? \\n5. Summarize the basic steps in the decision tree analysis methodology.\"),\n",

Moon Micro is a small manufacturer of servers that currently builds all of its product in \\nSanta Clara, California. As the market for servers has grown dramatically, the Santa Clara \\nplant has reached capacity of 10,000 servers per year. Moon is considering two options to \\nincrease its capacity. The first option is to add 10,000 units of capacity to the Santa Clara \\nplant at an annualized fixed cost of $10,000,000 plus $500 labor per server. The second \\noption is to have Molectron, an independent assembler, manufacture servers for Moon at a \\ncost of $2,000 for each server (excluding raw materials cost). Raw materials cost $8,000 per \\nserver, and Moon sells each server for $15,000. \\nMoon must make this decision for a two-year time horizon. During each year, demand \\nfor Moon servers has an 80 percent chance of increasing 50 percent from the year before and \\na 20 percent chance of remaining the same as the year before. Molectron's prices may \\nchange as well. They are ·fixed for the first year but have a 50 percent chance of increasing \\n20 percent in the second year and a 50 percent chance of remaining where they are. \\nUse a decision tree to determine whether Moon should add capacity to its Santa Clara \\nplant or if it should outsource to Molectron. What are some other factors that would affect \\nthis decision that we have not discussed? \\n2. Unipart, a manufacturer of auto parts, is considering two different B2B marketplaces to pur\\xad\\nchase its MRO supplies. Both marketplaces offer a full line of supplies at very similar prices \\nfor products and shipping. Both provide very similar service levels and lead times. \\nHowever, their fee structures are quite different. The first marketplace, Parts4u.com, \\nsells all of its products with a 5 percent commission tacked on top of the price of the product \\n(not including shipping). AllMRO.com's pricing is based on a ~·ubscription fee of $10 million \\nthat must be paid up front for a two-year period and a commission of 1 percent on each \\ntransaction's product price. \\nUnipart spends about $150 million on MRO supplies each year, although this varies \\nwith their utilization. Next year will likely be a strong year, in which high utilization will \\nkeep MRO spending at $150 million. However, there is a 25 percent chance that spending \\nwill drop by 10 percent. The second year, there is a 50 percent chance that the spending level \\nwill stay ~here it was in the first year and a 50 percent chance that it will drop by another \\n10 percent. Unipart uses a discount rate of 20 percent.

The firm had experienced a steep decline \\nin profits and very high costs at its plants in Germany and \\nJapan. Landgraf, the company\\'s president for worldwide \\noperations, knew that demand for the company\\'s prod\\xad\\nucts was stable across the globe. As a result, the surplus \\ncapacity in his global production network looked like a \\nluxury he could no longer afford. \\nAny improvement in financial performance was \\ndependent on having the most efficient network in place, \\nbecause revenues were unlikely to grow. Cutting costs \\nwas thus a top priority for the coming year. To help design \\na more cost-effective network, Landgraf assigned a task \\nforce to recommend a course of action. \\nBACKGROUND \\nBioPharma, Inc., is a global manufacturer of bulk chemi\\xad\\ncals used in the pharmaceutical industry. The company \\nholds patents on two chemicals that are called Highcal \\nand Relax internally. These bulk chemicals are used inter\\xad\\nnally by the company\\'s pharmaceutical division, and are \\nalso sold to other drug manufacturers. There are distinc\\xad\\ntions in the precise chemical specifications to be met in \\ndifferent parts of the world. All plants, however, are cur\\xad\\nrently set up to be able to produce both chemicals for any \\npart of the world. \\nFor 2005, sales of each product by region and the pro\\xad\\nduction and capacity at each plant are shown in Table 6-19. \\nThe plant capacity, measured in millions of kilograms \\nRegion Plant Capacity \\nLa tin America Brazil 18.0 \\nEurope Germany 45.0 \\nAsia w/o Japan India 18.0 \\nJapan Japan 10.0 \\nMexico Mexico 30.0 \\nU.S. U.S. 22.0 \\nof production, can be assigned to either chemical as long \\nas the plant is capable of producing both. BioPharma \\nhas forecast that its sales for the two chemicals are likely \\nto be stable for all parts of the world, except for Asia \\nwithout Japan, where sales are expected to grow by 10 \\npercent annually for each of the next five years before \\nstabilizing. \\nThe Japanese plant is a technology leader within the \\nBioPharma network in terms of its ability to handle regu\\xad\\nlatory and environmentaUssues. Some developments in \\nthe Japanese plant had been transferred to other plants in \\nthe network. The German plant is a leader in terms of its \\nproduction ability. The plant has routinely had the highest \\nyields within the global network. The Brazilian, Indian, \\nand Mexican plants have somewhat outdated technology \\nand are in need of an update. \\nCURRENT PLANT COSTS \\nAT BIOPHARMA \\nAfter considerable debate, the task force identified the \\ncost structure at each plant in 2005 as shown in Table \\n6-20. Each plant incurs an annual fixed cost that is inde\\xad\\npendent of the level of production in the plant. The fixed \\ncost includes depreciation, utilities, and the salaries and \\nfringe benefits of employees involved in general manage\\xad\\nment, scheduling, expediting, accounting, maintenance, \\nand so forth. Each plant that is capable of producing \\neither Highcal or Relax also incurs a product-related \\nfixed cost that is independent of the quantity of each \\nchemical produced.

Forecast demand in a supply chain given historical demand data using time-series \\nmethodologies. \\n4. Analyze demand forecasts to estimate forecast error. \\nF\\norecasts of future demand are essential for making supply chain decisions. In this \\nchapter, we explain how historical demand information can be used to forecast \\nfuture demand and how these forecasts affect the supply chain. We describe several \\nmethods to forecast demand and estimate a forecast's accuracy. We then discuss how \\nthese methods can be implemented using Microsoft Excel. \\nTHE ROLE OF FORECASTING IN A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nDemand forecasts form the basis of all supply chain planning. Consider the push/pull \\nview of the supply chain discussed in Chapter 1. All push processes in the supply chain \\nare performed in anticipation of customer demand, whereas all pull processes are per\\xad\\nformed in response to customer demand. For push processes, a manager must plan the \\nlevel of activity, be it production, transportation, or any other planned activity. For pull \\nprocesses, a-inanager must plan the level of available capacity and inventory but not \\n-the actual amount to be executed. In both instances, the first step a manager must take \\nis to forecast what customer demand will be. \\nFor example, Dell orders PC components in anticipation of customer orders, \\nwhereas it performs assembly in response to customer orders. Dell uses a forecast of \\nfuture demand to determine the quantity of components to have on hand (a push \\nprocess) and to determine the capacity needed in its plants (for pull production). \\nFarther up the supply chain, Intel also needs forecasts to determine its own produc\\xad\\ntion and inventory levels. Intel's suppliers also need forecasts for the same reason. \\nWhen each stage in the supply chain makes its own separate forecast, these forecasts \\nare often very different. The result is a mismatch between supply and demand. When \\nall stages of a supply chain work together to produce a collaborative forecast, it tends \\nto be much more accurate. The resulting forecast accuracy enables supply chains to \\nbe both more responsive and more efficient in serving their customers.

Coca-Cola decides on the timing of various promotions based on the demand \\nforecast over the coming quarter. Promotion decisions are then incorporated into an \\nupdated demand forecast. The updated forecast is essential for the bottlers to plan \\ntheir capacity and production decisions. A bottler operating without an updated fore\\xad\\ncast based on the promotion is unlikely to have sufficient supply available for Coca\\xad\\nCola, thus hurting supply chain profits. \\nMature products with stable demand, such as milk or paper towels, are usually eas\\xad\\niest to forecast. Forecasting and the accompanying managerial decisions are extremely \\ndifficult when either the supply of raw materials or the demand for the finished prod\\xad\\nuct is highly unpredictable. Fashion goods and many high-tech products are examples \\nof items that are difficult to forecast. Good forecasting is very important in these cases \\nbecause the time window for sales is narrow. If a firm has over-or underproduced, it \\nhas little chance to recover. For a product with stable demand, in contrast, the impact \\nof a forecasting error is less significant. \\nBefore we begin an in-depth discussion of the components of forecasts and fore\\xad\\ncasting methods in the supply chain, we briefly list characteristics of forecasts that a \\nmanager must understand to design and manage his or her supply chain effectively. \\n7.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF FORECASTS \\nCompanies and supply chain managers should be aware of the following characteris\\xad\\ntics of forecasts. \\n1. Forecasts are always wrong and should thus include both the expected value of the \\nforecast and a measure of forecast error. To understand the importance of forecast \\nerror, consider two car dealers. One of them expects sales to range between 100 and \\n1,900 units, whereas the other expects sales to range between 900 and 1,100 units. Even \\nthough both dealers anticipate average sales of 1,000, the sourcing policies for each \\ndealer should be very different given the difference in forecast accuracy. Thus, the fore\\xad\\ncast error (or demand uncertainty) must be a key input into most supply chain deci\\xad\\nsions. Unfortunately, most firms do not maintain any estimate of forecast error. \\n2. Long-term forecasts are usually less accurate than short-term forecasts; that is, long\\xad\\nterm forecasts have a larger standard deviation of error relative to the mean than \\nshort-term forecasts. Seven-Eleven Japan has exploited this key property to improve \\nits performance. The company has instituted a replenishment process that enables it to \\nrespond to an order within hours. For example, if a store manager places an order by \\n10 A.M., the order is delivered by 7 P.M. the same day. Therefore, the manager only has \\nto forecast what will sell that night less than 12 hours before the actual sale. The short \\nlead time allows a manager to take into account current information, such as the \\nweather, which could affect product sales. This forecast is likely to be more accurate \\nthan if the store manager had to forecast demand one week in advance. \\n3. Aggregate forecasts are usually more accurate than disaggregate forecasts, as they \\ntend to have a smaller standard deviation of error relative to the mean. For example, \\nit is easy to forecast the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States for a \\ngiven year with less than a 2 percent error. However, it is much more difficult to fore\\xad\\ncast yearly revenue for a company with less than a 2 percent error, and it is even \\n-~~~-~-------\\n------ ~ ---------------------~-~-'),\n",

The GDP is an \\naggregation across many companies and the earnings of a company are an aggrega\\xad\\ntion across several product lines. The greater the aggregation, the more accurate is the \\nforecast. \\n4. In general, the farther up the supply chain a company is (or the farther it is from the \\nconsumer), the greater is the distortion of information it receives. One classic example \\nof this is the bullwhip effect (see Chapter 17), in which order variation is amplified as \\norders move farther from the end customer. As a result, the farther up the supply chain \\nan enterprise is, the larger is the forecast error. Collaborative forecasting based on \\nsales to the end customer helps upstream enterprises reduce forecast error. \\nIn the next section, we discuss the basic components of a forecast, explain the four \\nclassifications into which forecasting methods fall, and introduce the notion of forecast \\nerror. \\nCOMPONENTS OF A FORECAST \\nAND FORECASTING METHODS \\nYogi Berra, the former New York Yankees catcher who is famous for his mala\\xad\\npropisms, once said, \"Predictions are usually difficult, especially about the future.\" One \\nmay be tempted to treat demand forecasting as magic or art and leave everything to \\nchance. What a firm knows about its customers\\' past behavior, however, sheds light on \\ntheir future behavior. Demand does not arise in a vacuum. Rather, customer demand is \\ninfluenced by a variety of factors and can be predicted, at least with some probability, \\nif a company can determine the relationship between these factors and future demand. \\nTo forecast demand, companies must first identify the factors that influence future \\ndemand and then ascertain the relationship between these factors and future demand. \\nCompanies must balance objective and subjective factors when forecasting \\ndemand. Although we focus on quantitative forecasting methods in this chapter, com\\xad\\npanies must include human input when they make their final forecast. Seven-Eleven \\nJapan illustrates this point. \\nSeven-Eleven Japan provides its store managers with a state-of-the-art decision \\nsupport system that makes a demand forecast and provides a recommended order. The \\nstore manager, however, is responsible for making the final decision and placing the \\norder, because he or she may have access to information about market conditions that \\nare not available in historical demand data. This knowledge of market conditions is \\nlikely to improve the forecast. For example, if the store manager knows that the \\nweather is likely to be rainy and cold the next day, he or she can reduce the size of an \\nice cream order to be placed with an upstream supplier, even if demand was high dur\\xad\\ning the previous few days when the weather was hot. In this instance, a change in mar\\xad\\nket conditions (the weather) would not have been predicted using historical demand \\ndata. A supply chain can experience substantial payoffs from improving its demand \\nforecasting through qualitative human inputs. \\nA company must be knowledgeable about numerous factors that are related to the \\ndemand forecast. Some of these factors are listed next. \\n• Past demand \\n• Lead time of product \\n• Planned advertising or marketing efforts'),\n",

For example, historically a firm may have experienced low \\ndemand for chicken noodle soup in July and high demand in December and January. If \\nthe firm decides to discount the product in July, the situation is likely to change, with \\nsome of the future demand shifting to the month of July. The firm should make its fore\\xad\\ncast taking this factor into consideration. \\nForecasting methods are classified according to the following four types. \\n1. Qualitative: Qualitative forecasting methods are primarily subjective and rely on \\nhuman judgment. They are most appropriate when little historical data is available \\nor when experts have market intelligence that may affect the forecast. Such methods may \\nalso be necessary to forecast demand several years into the future in a new mdustry. \\n2. Time series: Time-series forecasting methods use historical demand to make a fore\\xad\\ncast. They are based on the assumption that past demand history is a good indicator of \\nfuture demand. These methods are most appropriate when the basic demand pattern \\ndoes not vary significantly from one year to the next. These are the simplest methods to \\nimplement and can serve as a good starting point for a demand forecast. \\n3. Causal: Causal forecasting methods assume that the demand forecast is highly cor\\xad\\nrelated with certain factors in the environment (the state of the economy, interest rates, \\netc.). Causal forecasting methods find this correlation between demand and environ\\xad\\nmental factors and use estimates of what environmental factors will be to forecast \\nfuture demand. For example, product pricing is strongly correlated with demand. \\nCompanies can thus use causal methods to determine the impact of price promotions \\non demand. \\n4. Simulation: Simulation forecasting methods imitate the consumer choices that give \\nrise to demand to arrive at a forecast. Using simulation, a firm can combine time-series \\nand causal methods to answer such questions as: What will be the impact of a price pro\\xad\\nmotion? What will be the impact of a competitor opening a store nearbyq Airlines sim\\xad\\nulate customer buying behavior to forecast demand for higher-fare seats when there \\nare no seats available at the lower fares. \\nA company may find it difficult to decide which method is most appropriate for \\nforecasting. In fact, several studies have indicated that using multiple forecasting meth\\xad\\nods to create a combined forecast is more effective than using any one method alone. \\nIn this chapter we deal primarily with time-series methods, which are most appro\\xad\\npriate when future demand is related to historical demand, growth patterns, and any \\nseasonal patterns. With any forecasting method, there is always a random element that \\ncannot be explained by historical demand patterns. Therefore, any obs·~rved demand \\ncan be broken down into a systematic and a random component: \\nObserved demand ( 0) = systematic component (S) + random component (R) \\nThe systematic component measures the expected value of demand and consists of \\nwhat we will call level, the current deseasonalized demand; trend, the rate of growth or \\ndecline in demand for the .next period; and seasonality, the predictable s·~asonal fluctu\\xad\\nations in demand. \\nThe random component is that part of the forecast that deviates from the system\\xad\\natic part. A company cannot (and should not) forecast the direction of the random \\n- --·--------'),\n",

All a company can predict is the random component's size and variability, \\nwhich provides a measure of forecast error. On average, a good forecasting method has \\nan error whose size is comparable to the random component of demand. A manager \\nshould be skeptical of a forecasting method that claims to have no forecasting erro:: on \\nhistorical demand. In this case, the method has merged the historical random compo\\xad\\nnent with the systematic component. As a result, the forecasting method will likely per\\xad\\nform poorly. The objective of forecasting is to filter out the random component (noise) \\nand estimate the systematic component. The forecast error measures the difference \\nbetween the forecast and actual demand. \\nBASIC APPROACH TO DEMAND FORECASTING \\nThe following basic, six-step approach helps an organization perform effective fore\\xad\\ncasting. \\n1. Understand the objective of forecasting. \\n2. Integrate demand planning and forecasting throughout the supply chain. \\n3. Understand and identify customer segments. \\n4. Identify the major factors that influence the demand forecast. \\n5. Determine the appropriate forecasting technique. \\n6. Establish performance and error measures for the forecast. \\nUNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVE OF FORECASTING \\nEvery forecast supports decisions that are based on the forecast, so an important first \\nstep is to identify these decisions clearly. Examples of such decisions include how much \\nof a particular product to make, how much to inventory, and how much to order. All par\\xad\\nties affected by a supply chain decision should be aware of the link between the decision \\nand the forecast. For example, Wal-Mart's plans to discount detergent during the mt)nth \\nof July must be shared with the manufacturer, the transporter, and others involved in \\nfilling demand, as they all must make decisions that are affected by the forecast of \\ndemand. All parties should come up with a common forecast for the promotion and a \\nshared plan of action based on the forecast. Failure to make these decisions jointly may \\nresult in either too much or too little product in various stages of the supply chain. \\nINTEGRATE DEMAND PLANNING AND FORECASTING \\nTHROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nA company should link its forecast to all planning activities throughout the supply chain. \\nThese include capacity planning, production planning, promotion planning, and purchas\\xad\\ning, among others. This link should exist at both the information system and the human \\nresources management level. As a variety of functions are affected by the outcom~s of \\nthe planning process, it is important that all of them are integrated into the forecasting \\nprocess. In one unfortunately common scenario, a retailer develops forecasts based on \\npromotional activities, whereas a manufacturer, unaware of these promotions, develops a \\ndifferent forecast for its production planning based on historical orders. This leads to a \\nmismatch between supply and demand, resulting in poor customer service. \\nTo accomplish this integration, it is a good idea for a firm to have a cross-functional \\nteam, with members from each affected function responsible for forecasting demand\\xad\\nand an even better idea is to have members of different companies in the supply chain \\nworking together to create a forecast. \\n-----------------\"),\n",

Customers may be \\ngrouped by similarities in service requirements, demand volumes, order frequency, \\ndemand volatility, seasonality, and so forth. In general, companies may use different \\nforecasting methods for different segments. A clear understanding of the customer seg\\xad\\nments facilitates an accurate and simplified approach to forecasting. \\nIDENTIFY MAJOR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE \\nTHE DEMAND FORECAST \\nNext, a finn must identify demand, supply, and product-related phenomena that influ\\xad\\nence the demand forecast. On the demand side, a company must ascertain whether \\ndemand is growing, declining, or has a seasonal pattern. These estimates must be based \\non demad-not sales data. For example, a supermarket promoted a certain brand of \\ncereal in July 2005. As a result, the demand for this cereal was high while the demand \\nfor other, comparable cereal brands was low in July. The supermarket should not use \\nthe sales data from 2005 to estimate that demand for this brand will be high in July \\n2006, because this will occur only if the same brand is promoted again in July 2006 and \\nother brands respond as they did the previous year. When making the demand fore\\xad\\ncast, the supermarket must understand what the demand would have been in the \\nabsence of promotion activity and how demand is affected by promotions and competi\\xad\\ntor actions. A combination of these pieces of information will allow the supermarket to \\nforecast demand for July 2006 given the promotion activity planned for that year. \\nOn the supply side, a cOinpqny must consicier the available supply sources to \\ndecide on the accuracy of the forecast desired. If alternate supply sources with short \\nlead times are available, a highly accurate forecast may not be especially important. \\nHowever, if only a single supplier with a long lead time is available, an accurate fore\\xad\\ncast will have great value. \\nOn the product side, a finn must know the number of variants of a product being \\nsold and whether these variants substitute for or complement each other. If demand \\nfor a product influences or is influenced by demand for another product, the two fore\\xad\\ncasts are best made jointly. For example, when a finn introduces an improved version \\nof an existing product, it is likely that the demand for the existing product will decline \\nbecause new customers will buy the improved version. Although the decline in demand \\nfor the original product is not indicated by historical data, the historical demand is still \\nuseful in that it allows the firm to estimate the combined total demand for the two ver\\xad\\nsions~ Clearly, demand for the two products should be forecast jointly. \\nDETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE FORECASTING TECHNIQUE \\nIn selecting an appropriate forecasting technique, a company should first understand the \\ndimensions that are relevant to the forecast. These dimensions include geographic area, \\nproduct groups, and customer groups. The company should understand the differences in \\ndemand along each dimension and will likely want different forecasts and techniques for \\neach dimension. At this stage, a firm selects an appropriate forecasting method from \\namong the four methods discussed earlier--qualitative, time-series, causal, or simulation. \\nAs mentioned earlier, using a combination of these methods is often most effective. \\nESTABLISH PERFORMANCE AND ERROR MEASURES \\nFOR THE FORECAST \\nCompanies should establish clear performance measures to evaluate the accuracy and \\ntimeliness of the forecast. These measures should be highly correlated with the objectives'),\n",

For example, consider a mail-order \\ncompany that uses a forecast to place orders with its suppliers up the supply chain. \\nSuppliers take two months to send in the orders. The mail-order company must emure \\nthat the forecast is created at least two months before the start of the sales season \\nbecause of the two-month lead time for replenishment. At the end of the sales season, \\nthe company must compare actual demand to forecasted demand to estimate the accu\\xad\\nracy of the forecast. Then plans for decreasing future forecast errors or responding to \\nthe observed forecast errors can be put into place. \\nIn the next section, we discuss techniques for static and adaptive time-series \\nforecasting. \\nTIME-SERIES FORECASTING METHODS \\nThe goal of any forecasting method is to predict the systematic component of demand \\nand estimate the random component. In its most general form, the systematic compo\\xad\\nnent of demand data contains a level, a trend, and a seasonal factor. The equation for \\ncalculating the systematic component may take a variety of forms, as shown following. \\n• Multiplicative: Systematic component = level X trend X seasonal factor \\n• Additive: Systematic component = level + trend + seasonal factor \\n• Mixed: Systematic component = (level + trend) X seasonal factor \\nThe specific form of the systematic component applicable to a given forecast depends \\non the nature of demand. Companies may develop both static and adaptive forecasting \\nmethods for each form. We now describe these static and adaptive forecasting methods. \\nSTATIC METHODS \\nA static method assumes that the estimates of level, trend, and seasonality within the \\nsystematic component do not vary as new demand is observed. In this case, we estimate \\neach of these parameters based on historical data and then use the same values for all \\nfuture forecasts .. In this section we discuss a static forecasting method for use when \\ndemand has a trend as well as a seasonal component. We assume that the systematic \\ncomponent of demand is mixed, that is, \\nSystematic component = (level + trend) X seasonal factor \\nA similar approach can be applied for other forms as well. We begin with a few \\nbasic definitions: \\nL = estimate of level at t = 0 (the deseasonalized demand estimate during \\nPeriod t = 0) \\nT = estimate of trend (increase or decrease in demand per period) \\nS1 = estimate of seasonal factor for Period t \\nD 1 = actual demand observed in Period t \\nF1 = forecast of demand for Period t \\nIn a static forecasting method, the forecast in Period t for demand in Period t + lis \\ngiven as \\nFt+z = [L + (t + l)T]St+l (7.1) \\nWe now describe one method for estimating the three parameters L, T, and S.

In the past, \\nTahoe Salt has relied on estimates of demand from a sample of its retailers, but the \\ncompany has noticed that these retailers always overestimate their purchases, leaving \\nTahoe (and even some retailers) stuck with excess inventory. After meeting with its \\nretailers, Tahoe has decided to produce a collaborative forecast. Tahoe Salt wants to \\nwork with the retailers to create a more accurate forecast based on the actual retail \\nsales of their salt. Quarterly retail demand data for the last three years is shown in \\nTable 7-1 and charted in Figure 7-1. \\nIn Figure 7-1, observe that demand for salt is seasonal, increasing from the second \\nquarter of a given year to the first quarter of the following year.

There is also a growth trend in the demand, with sales growing \\nover the last three years. The company estimates that growth will continue in the com\\xad\\ning year at historical rates.

We start by \\ndeseasonalizing the demand data. Deseasonalized demand represents the demand that \\nwould have been observed in the absence of seasonal fluctuations. The periodicity p is \\nthe number of periods after which the seasonal cycle repeats. For Tahoe Salt\\'s demand, \\nthe pattern repeats every year. Given that we are measuring demand on a quarterly \\nbasis, the periodicity for the demand in Table 7-1 is p = 4. \\nTo ensure that each season is given equal weight when deseasonalizing demand, \\nwe take the average of p consecutive periods of demand. The average of demand from \\nPeriod l + 1 to Period l + p provides deseasonalized demand for Period l + (p + 1)/2. If \\np is odd, this method provides deseasonalized demand for an existing period. If p is \\neven, this method provides deseasonalized demand at a point between Period l + (p/2) \\nand l + 1 + (p/2). By taking the average of deaseasonalized demand provided by \\nPeriods l + 1 to l + p and l + 2 to l + p + 1, we obtain the deseasonalized demand for \\nPeriod l + 1 + (p/2). This procedure for obtaining the deseasonalized demand, Dr, for \\nPeriod t, is formulated as follows: \\n{ \\n[ Dr-(p/2) + Dr+(p/2) + t-1-!/\\n2\\n) 2Di ]/ 2p for p even \\nD _ i=t+l-(p/2) \\nt - t+(p/2) \\n\"5\\'.

We now discuss a basic framework and several methods that \\ncan be used for this type of forecast. The framework is provided in the most general \\nsetting, when the systematic component of demand data contains a level, a trend, and a \\nseasonal factor. The framework we present is for the case in which the systematic com\\xad\\nponent has the mixed form. It can, however, easily be modified for the other two cases. \\nThe framework can also be specialized for the case in which the systematic component \\ncontains no seasonality or trend. We assume that we have a set of historical data for n \\nperiods and that demand is seasonal with periodicity p. Given quarterly data, where \\nthe pattern repeats itself every year, we have a periodicity of p = 4. \\nWe begin by defining a few terms: \\nLr = estimate of level at the end of Period t \\nTr = estimate of trend at the end of Period t \\nSr = estimate of seasonal factor for Period t \\nFe =forecast of demand for Period t (made in Period t -1 or earlier) \\nDr= actual demand observed in Period t \\nEr = forecast error in Period t \\nIn adaptive methods, the forecast for Period t + l in Period t is given as \\nFt+t == (Lr + lTr)Sr+l \\nThe four steps in the adaptive forecasting framework are as follows. \\n(7.7) \\n1. Initialize: Compute initial estimates of the level (Lo), trend (To), and seasonal fac\\xad\\ntors (S1, ... , Sp) from the given data. This is done exactly as in the static forecasting \\nmethod discussed earlier in the chapter. \\n2. Forecast: Given the estimates in Period t, forecast demand for Period t + 1 using \\nEquation 7.7. Our first forecast is for Period 1 and is made with the estimates of \\nlevel, trend, and seasonal factor at Period 0. \\n3. Estimate error: Record the actual demand Dr+l for Period t + 1 and compute the \\nerror Er+l in the forecast for Period t + 1 as the difference between the forecast \\nand the actual demand. The error for Period t + 1 is stated as \\n(7.8) \\n4. Modify estimates: Modify the estimates of level (Lr+l), trend (Tr+l), and seasonal fac\\xad\\ntor (Sr+p+l), given the error Er+l in the forecast. It is desirable that the modification be \\nsuch that if the demand is lower than forecast, the estimates are revised downward, \\nwhereas if the demand is higher than forecast, the estimates are revised upward. \\nThe revised estimates in Period t + 1 are then used to make a forecast for Period \\nt + 2, and Steps 2, 3, and 4 are repeated until all historical data up to Period n have been \\ncovered. The estimates at Period n are then used to forecast future demand. \\nWe now discuss various adaptive forecasting methods. The method that is most appro\\xad\\npriate depends on the characteristic of demand and the composition of the systematic \\ncomponent of demand. In each case we assume the period under consideration to be t. \\nMoving Average \\nThe moving-average method is used when demand has no observable trend or .season\\xad\\nality.

Forecast error helps identify instances in which the forecasting method \\nbeing used is inappropriate. In the next section, we describe how a manager can ·~sti\\xad\\nmate and use forecast error. \\nMEASURES OF FORECAST ERROR \\nAs mentioned earlier, every instance of demand has a random component. A good \\nforecasting method should capture the systematic component of demand but not the \\nrandom component. The random component manifests itself in the form of a forecast \\nerror. Forecast errors contain valuable information and must be analyzed carefully for \\ntwo reasons: \\n1. Managers use error analysis to determine whether the current forecasting method is \\npredicting the systematic component of demand accurately. For example, if a forecast\\xad\\ning method consistently produces a positive error, the forecasting method is overesti\\xad\\nmating the systematic component and should be corrected. \\n2. All contingency plans must account for forecast error. For example, consider a mail\\xad\\norder company with two suppliers. The first is in the Far East and has a lead time of two \\nmonths. The second is local and can fill orders with one week\\'s notice. The local sup\\xad\\nplier is more expensive, whereas the Far East supplier costs less. The mail-order com\\xad\\npany wants to contract a certain amount of contingency capacity with the local supplier \\nto be used if the demand exceeds the quantity the Far East supplier provides. The deci\\xad\\nsion regarding the quantity of local capacity to contract is closely linked to the size of \\nthe forecast error. \\nAs long as observed errors are within historical error estimates, firms can continue \\nto use their current forecasting method. Finding an error that is well beyond historical \\nestimates may indicate that the forecasting method in use is no longer appropriate. If \\nall of a firm\\'s forecasts tend to consistently over-or underestimate demand, this may \\nbe another signal that the firm should change its forecasting method. \\nAs defined earlier, forecast error for Period tis given by Ee, where the following \\nholds: \\nEe =Fe- De \\nThat is, the error in Period tis the difference between the forecast for Period z and \\nthe actual demand in Period t. It is important that a manager estimate the error of a \\nforecast made at least as far in advance as the lead time required for the manager ,to \\ntake whatever action the forecast is to be used for. For example, if a forecast will be \\nused to determine an order size and the supplier\\'s lead time is six months, a manager \\nshould estimate the error for a forecast made six months before demand arises. In a sit\\xad\\nuation with a six-month lead time, there is no point in estimating errors for a forecast \\nmade one month in advance. \\nOne measure of forecast error is the mean squared error (MSE), where the follow\\xad\\ning holds: \\n1 n \\nMSE = -\" £ 2 \\nn .k.J e ne=l \\n(7.21) \\nThe MSE can be related to the variance of the forecast error. In effect, we estimate \\nthat the random component of demand has a mean of 0 and a variance of MSE.'),\n",

From Figure 7-6, observe that \\nL12 = 23,490 \\nThus, the forecast for the next four quart~rs (using Equation 7.12) is given by \\nF13 = F14 = F1s = F16 = L12 = 23,490 \\nIn this case, MAD 12 is 10,208 and MAPE 12 is 59 percent. Thus, the estimate of stan\\xad\\ndard deviation of forecast error using simple exponential smoothing is 1.25 x \\n10,208 = 12,761. In this case, the standard deviation of forecast error is fairly large rel\\xad\\native to the size of the forecast. \\nTR~ND-CORRECTED EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING (HOLT'S MODEL) \\nThe team next investigates the use of Holt's model.

As a first step, they estimate \\nthe level at Period 0 and the initial trend. As described in Example 7-3, this estimate is \\nobtained by running a linear regression between demand, D 1, and time, Period t. From \\nthe regression of the available data, the team obtains the following: \\nL 0 = 12,015 and To= 1,549 \\nThe team now applies Holt's model with a = 0.1 and 13 = 0.2 to obtain the fore\\xad\\ncasts for each of the 12 quarters for which demand data are available.

These methodolo\\xad\\ngies often give a more accurate forecast than what can be produced through the use of a \\ngeneral package such as Excel. Most demand planning applications make it fairly easy \\nto test the various forecasting algorithms against historical data to determine the one \\nthat provides the best fit to the observed demand patterns. The availability of a variety \\nof forecasting options is important because different forecasting algorithms provide dif\\xad\\nferent levels of quality depending on the actual demand patterns.

This helps \\nfirms respond quickly to changes in the marketplace and avoid the costs of a delayed \\nreaction. Good demand planning modules link not only to customer orders but often \\ndirectly to customer sales information as well, thus incorporating the most current data \\ninto the demand forecast. Much of the progress in areas such as collaborative planning \\nis due to IT innovations that allow the exchange and incorporation of forecasts \\nbetween enterprises. \\nFinally, as the name demand planning suggests, these modules facilitate the shap\\xad\\ning of demand. Good demand planning modules contain tools to perform what-if \\nanalysis regarding the impact of potential changes in prices on demand. These tools \\nhelp analyze the impact of promotions on demand and can be used to determine the \\nextent and timing of promotions. \\nKeep in mind that none of these tools is foolproof. Forecasts are virtually always \\nwrong. A good IT system should help track historical forecast errors so they can be \\nincorporated into future decisions. A well-structured forecast, along with a measure of \\nerror, can significantly improve decision making. Even with all these sophisticated \\ntools, sometimes it is better to rely on human intuition in forecasting. One of the pit\\xad\\nfalls of these IT tools is relying on them too much, which eliminates the human ele\\xad\\nment in forecasting. Use the forecasts and the value they deliver, but remember that \\nthey cannot assess some of the more qualitative aspects about future demand that you \\nmay be able to do on your own. \\nForecasting modules are available from all the major supply chain software com\\xad\\npanies, including the ERP firms such as SAP and Oracle, as well as the best of breed \\nsupply chain players such as i2 Technologies and Manugistics. There are also a number \\nof statistical analysis software firms, such as SAS, whose programs can be used for fore\\xad\\ncasting. Finally, some of the CRM-focused firms have elements of forecasting in their \\nproducts, given their focus on customer facing processes. \\nForecasting and IT have a long history. The forecasting module is one of three core \\nproducts around which the entire supply chain software industry grew. The classic \\nsupply chain IT package has a forecasting module feeding forecasts to a planning mod\\xad\\nule. The module sets schedules and inventory levels, which are then fed to an execution \\nsystem that actually executes these plans. Thus, forecasting is a core part of IT in the \\nsupply chain . \\n. 9 RISK MANAGEMENT IN FORECASTING \\nThe risks associated with forecast error must be considered when planning for the \\nfuture. Errors in forecasting can cause significant misallocation of resources in inven\\xad\\ntory, facilities, transportation, sourcing, pricing, and even in information management. \\nForecast errors during network design may cause too many, too few, or the wrong type \\nof facilities to be built. At the planning level, plans are determined from foreca~ts so \\nthe actual inventory, production, transportation, sourcing, and pricing plans that a com\\xad\\npany produces and follows depend on accurate forecasting. Even on an operational \\nlevel, forecasting plays a role in the actual day-to-day activities that are executed \\nwithin a company. As one of the initial processes in each of these phases that affects \\nmany other processes, forecasting contains a significant amount of inherent risk. \\nA wide range of factors can cause a forecast to be wrong, but a few occur so \\noften that they deserve specific mention. Long lead times require forecasts to be'),\n",

Seasonality \\nalso tends to increase forecast error. Forecast errors increase when product life cycles \\nare short, because there are few historical data to build on when producing a forecast. \\nFirms with a few customers often experience very lumpy demand that is harder to fore\\xad\\ncast than demand from many small customers, which tends to be smoother. Forecast \\nquality suffers when it is based on orders placed by intermediaries in a supply chain \\nrather than on end customer demand. This was particularly evident in the telecommu\\xad\\nnications sector in 2001, when manufacturer forecasts exceeded customer demand by a \\nlarge amount. Without a view of end customer demand, a firm always has difficulty \\nproducing reliable forecasts. \\nTwo strategies used to mitigate forecast risk are increasing the responsiveness of \\nthe supply chain and utilizing opportunities for pooling of demand. W.W. Grainger has \\nworked with suppliers to decrease lead times from eight weeks to less than three \\nweeks. Increased responsiveness allows the firm to reduce forecasting errors and thus \\ndecrease the associated risk. Pooling, which we discuss in Chapter 11, attempts to \\nsmooth out lumpy demand by bringing together multiple sources of demand. Thus, \\nAmazon has a lower forecast error than Borders because it pools geographic demand \\ninto its warehouses. \\nImproved responsiveness and pooling often come at a cost. Increased speed may \\nrequire capacity investment, whereas pooling tends to increase transportation cost. To \\nachieve the right balance between risk mitigation and cost, it is important to tailor the \\nmitigation strategies. For instance, when dealing with a commodity for which shortfalls \\ncan easily be made up for by spot market purchases, spending large amounts to \\nincrease the responsiveness of the supply chain is not warranted. In contrast, for a \\nproduct with a short life cycle, investing in responsiveness may be worth the cost. \\nSimilarly, the benefit from pooling is likely to be large only when the underlying fore\\xad\\ncast error is high. An investment in pooling efforts may not be justified for products \\nwith small forecast errors. \\n7.10 FORECASTING IN PRACTICE \\nCollaborate in building forecasts. Collaboration with your supply chain partners can \\noften create a much more accurate forecast. It takes an investment of time and effort \\nto build the relationships with your partners to begin sharing information and creating \\ncollaborative forecasts. However, the supply chain benefits of collaboration are often \\nan order of magnitude greater than the cost. The reality today, however, is that most \\nforecasts do not even account for all the information available across the different \\nfunctions of a firm. Progress needs to be made before all supply chain information is \\naccounted for and utilized. \\nShare only the data that truly provide value. The value of data depends on where \\none sits in the supply chain. For instance, a retailer finds point-of-sale data to be quite \\nvaluable in measuring the performance of its stores. However, a manufacturer selling \\nto a distributor who in turn sells to retailers does not need all the point-of-sale detail. \\nThe manufacturer finds aggregate demand data to be quite valuable, with marginally \\nmore value coming from detailed point-of-sale data. Keeping the data shared to what \\nis truly required decreases investment in IT and improves the chances of successful \\ncollaboration. \\nBe sure to distinguish between demand and sales. Often, companies make the mistake \\nof looking at historical sales and assuming that this is what the historical demand was. To \\n-·-----~-~----------~ \\n'\"),\n",

Failure to do so results in forecasts that do \\nnot represent the current reality . \\n. 11 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Understand the role of forecasting for both an enterprise and a supply chain. \\nForecasting is a key driver of virtually every design and planning decision made in both \\nan enterprise and a supply chain. Enterprises have always forecasted demand and used it \\nto make decisions. A relatively recent phenomenon, however, is to create collaborative \\nforecasts for an entire supply chain and use this as the basis for decisions. Collaborative fore\\xad\\ncasting greatly increases the accuracy of forecasts and allows the supply chain to maximize \\nits performance. Without collaboration, supply chain stages farther from demand will likely \\nhave poor forecasts that will lead to supply chain inefficiencies and a lack of responsiveness. \\n2. Identify the components of a demand forecast. \\nDemand consists of a systematic and a random component. The systematic component \\nmeasures the expected value of demand. The random component measures fluctuations in \\ndemand from the expected value. The systematic component consists of level, trend, anc~ sea\\xad\\nsonality. Level measures the current deseasonalized demand. Trend measures the current \\nrate of growth or decline in demand. Seasonality indicates predictable seasonal fluctuations \\nin demand. \\n3. Forecast demand in a supply chain given historical data using time-series methodologies. \\nTime-series methods for forecasting are categorized as static or adaptive. In static meth\\xad\\nods, the estimates of parameters and demand patterns are not updated as new demand is \\nobserved. Static methods include regression. In adaptive methods, the estimates are updated \\neach time a new demand is observed. Adaptive methods include moving averages, \\nsimple exponential smoothing, Holt's model, and Winter's model. Moving averages and \\nsimple exponential smoothing are best used when demand displays no trend or seasonality. \\nHolt's model is best when demand displays a trend but no seasonality. Winter's model is \\nappropriate when demand displays both trend and seasonality. \\n4. Analyze demand forecasts to estimate forecast error. \\nForecast error measures the random component of demand. This measure is important \\nbecause it reveals how inaccurate a forecast is likely to be and what contingencies a firm may \\nhave to plan for. The MAD and the MAPE are used to estimate the size of the forecast ·~rror. \\nThe bias-and TS are used to estimate ifthe forecast consistently over-or underforecasts. \\nDiscussion Questions \\n1. What role does forecasting play in the supply chain of a build-to-order manufacturer such as \\nDell? \\n2. How could Dell use collaborative forecasting with its suppliers to improve its supply chain? \\n3. What role does forecasting play in the supply chain of a mail order firm such as L.L.Bean? \\n4. What systematic and random components would you expect in demand for chocolates? \\n5. Why should a manager be suspicious if a forecaster claims to forecast historical demand \\nwithout any forecast error? \\n6. Give examples of products that display seasonality of demand. \\n7. ·What is the problem if a manager uses last year's sales data instead of last year's demand to \\nforecast demand for the coming year? \\n8.

We also describe \\nhow to formulate and solve an aggregate planning problem using Microsoft Excel. \\n8.1 THE ROLE OF AGGREGATE PLANNING \\nIN A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nImagine a world in which manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, and even infor\\xad\\nmation capacity are all limitless and free. Imagine lead times of zero, allowing goods to \\nbe produced and delivered instantaneously. In this world, there would be no need to \\nplan !!1 anticipation of demand, because whenever a customer demands a product, the \\ndemand would be instantly satisfied. In this world, aggregate planning plays no role. \\nIn the real world, however, capacity has a cost, and lead times are often long. \\nTherefore, companies must make decisions regarding capacity levels, production levels, \\noutsourcing, and promotions well before demand is known. A company must anticipate \\ndemand and determine, in advance of that demand, how to meet it. Should a company \\ninvest in a plant with large capacity that is able to produce enough to satisfy demand even \\nin the busiest months? Or should a company build a smaller plant but incur the costs of \\nholding inventory built during slow periods in anticipation of demand in later months? \\nThese are the types of questions that aggregate planning helps companies answer. \\nAggregate planning is a process by which a company determines ideal levels of \\ncapacity, production, subcontracting, inventory, stockouts, and even pricing over a speci\\xad\\nfied time horizon. The goal of aggregate planning is to satisfy demand while maximizing \\nprofit. Aggregate planning, as the name suggests, solves problems involving aggregate \\ndecisions rather than stock-keeping unit (SKU)-level decisions. For example, aggregate \\nplanning determines the total production level in a plant for a given month, but it does so \\n-------~-~--~---~----~-----------~-\\n-------~---~---\\n' .-~-\"),\n",

This \\nlevel of detail makes aggregate planning a useful tool for thinking about decisions with \\nan intermediate time frame of between roughly 3 and 18 months. In this time frame, it is \\ntoo early to determine production levels by SKU, but it is also generally too late to \\narrange for additional capacity. Therefore, aggregate planning answers the question, \\n\"How should a firm best utilize the facilities that it currently has?\" \\nTraditionally, much of aggregate planning is focused within an enterprise and may \\nnot always be seen as a part of supply chain management. Aggregate planning, how\\xad\\never, is an important supply chain issue. To be effective, it requires inputs from \\nthroughout the supply chain, and its results have a tremendous impact on supply chain \\nperformance. As we saw in the previous chapter on forecasting, collaborative forecasts \\nare created by multiple supply chain enterprises and are an important input for aggre\\xad\\ngate planning. Good forecasts require collaboration with downstream supply chain \\npartners. In addition, many constraints in aggregate planning come from supply chain \\npartners outside the enterprise. These constraints are key inputs to aggregate planning, \\nmainly from upstream partners in the supply chain. Without these inputs from both up \\nand down the supply chain, aggregate planning cannot realize its full potential to cre\\xad\\nate value. The output from aggregate planning is also of value to both upstream and \\ndownstream partners. Production plans for a firm define demand for suppliers and \\nestablish supply constraints for customers. This chapter is meant to create a foundation \\nfor using aggregate planning both solely within an enterprise as well as across the \\nentire supply chain. The supply chain implications of aggregate planning will become \\neven more clear in Chapter 9 once the foundations of aggregate planning are in place. \\nAs an example, consider how a premium paper supply chain uses aggregate plan\\xad\\nning to maximize profit. Many types of paper mills face seasonal demand that ripples \\nup from customers to printers to distributors and finally to the manufacturers. Many \\ntypes of premium paper have demand peaks in the spring, when annual reports are \\nprinted, and in the fall, when new-car brochures are released. Building a mill with \\ncapacity to meet demand in the spring and fall on an as-needed basis is too costly, \\nbecause of the high cost of mill capacity. On the other side of the supply chain, pre\\xad\\nmium papers often require special additives and coatings that may be in short supply. \\nThe paper manufacturer must deal with these constraints and maximize profit around \\nthem. To deal with these potential problems, mills use aggregate planning to determine \\nproduction levels and inventory levels that they should build up in the slower months \\nfor sale in the spring and fall when demand is greater than the mill\\'s capacity. By taking \\ninto account the inputs from throughout the supply chain, aggregate planning aUows \\nthe mill and-the supply chain to maximize profit. \\nThe aggregate planner\\'s main objective is to identify the following operational \\nparameters over the specified time horizon: \\nProduction Rate: the number of units to be completed per unit time (such \\nas per week or per month) \\nWorkforce: the number of workers/units of capacity needed for production \\nOvertime: the amount of overtime production planned \\nMachine Capacity Level: the number of units of machine capacity needed \\nfor production \\nSubcontracting: the subcontracted capacity required over the planning horizon \\nBacklog: demand not satisfied in the period in which it arises but carried \\nover to future periods \\nInventory on Hand: the planned inventory carried over the various periods in \\nthe planning horizon'),\n",

The \\naggregate plan allows the supply chain to alter capacity allocations and change supply \\ncontracts. As mentioned in earlier chapters, the entire supply chain should be coordi\\xad\\nnated with the planning process. If a manufacturer has planned an increase in produc\\xad\\ntion over a given time period, the supplier, transporter, and warehouser must be aware \\nof this plan and incorporate the increase into their own plans. Ideally, all stages of the \\nsupply chain should work together on an aggregate plan that optimizes supply chain \\nperformance. If each stage develops its own aggregate plan independently, it is \\nextremely unlikely that all the plans will mesh in a coordinated manner. This lack of \\ncoordination results in shortages or oversupply in the supply chain. Therefore, it is \\nimportant to perform aggregate plans over a wide scope of the supply chain. \\nIn the next section, we formally define the aggregate planning problem. We specify \\nthe information required for aggregate planning and discuss the decision outcomes \\nthat aggregate planning can provide. \\n8.2 THE AGGREGATE PLANNING PROBLEM \\nThe objective of the aggregate plan is to satisfy demand in a way that maximizes profit \\nfor the firm. We can state the aggregate planning problem formally as follows: \\nGiven the demand forecast for each period in the planning horizon, deter\\xad\\nmine the production level, inventory level, and capacity level (internal :md \\noutsourced) for each period that maximizes the firm's profit over the plan\\xad\\nning horizon. \\nTo create an aggregate plan, a company must specify the planning horizon for the plan. \\nA planning horizon is the time period over which the aggregate plan is to produce a \\nsolution-usually between 3 and 18 months. A company must also specify the duration \\nof each period within the planning horizon (e.g., weeks, months, or quarters). In gen\\xad\\neral, aggregate planning takes place over months or quarters. Next, a company speci\\xad\\nfies key information required to produce an aggregate plan and to make the decisions \\nfor which the aggregate plan will develop recommendations. This information and the \\nrecommendations are specified for a generic aggregate planning problem in this \\nsection. The model we propose in the next section is flexible enough to accommodate \\nsituation-specific requirements. \\nAn aggregate planner requires the following information: \\n• Demand forecast Fr for each Period tin a planning horizon that extends over \\nTperiods \\n• Production costs \\n• Labor costs, regular time ($/hour), and overtime costs ($/hour) \\n• Cost of subcontracting production ($/unit or $/hour) \\n• Cost of changing capacity; specifically, cost of hiring/laying off workforce \\n($/worker) and cost of adding or reducing machine capacity ($/machine) \\n• Labor/machine hours required per unit \\n• Inventory holding cost ($/unit/period) \\n• Stockout or backlog cost ($/unit/period) \\n• Constraints \\n• Limits on overtime \\n• Limits on layoffs\"),\n",

A poor aggregate plan can result in lost sales and lost profits if the available \\ninventory and capacity are unable to meet demand. A poor aggregate plan may also \\nresult in a large amount of excess inventory and capacity, thereby raising costs. \\nTherefore, aggregate planning is a very important tool in helping a supply chain maxi\\xad\\nmize profitability. \\nAGGREGATE PLANNING STRATEGIES \\nThe aggregate planner must make trade-offs among capacity, inventory, and backlog \\ncosts. An aggregate plan that increases one of these costs typically results in reduction \\nof the other two. In this sense, the costs represent a trade-off-to lower inventory cost, \\na planner must increase capacity cost or delay delivery to the customer. Thus the plan\\xad\\nner trades inventory cost for capacity or backlog cost. Arriving at the most profitable \\ncombination of trade-offs is the goal of aggregate planning. Given that demand varies \\nover time, the relative level of the three costs leads to one of them being the key lever \\nthe planner uses to maximize profits. If the cost of varying capacity is low, a company \\nmay not need to build inventory or carry backlogs. If the cost of varying capacity is \\nhigh, a company may compensate by building some inventory and carrying some back\\xad\\nlogs from peak demand periods to off-peak de:q1and periods. \\nIn general, a company attempts to use a combination of the three costs to best \\nmeet demand. Therefore, the fundamental trade-offs available to a planner are among \\n• Capacity (regular time, overtime, subcontracted) \\n• Inventory \\n• Backlog/lost sales because of delay \\nThere are essentially three distinct aggregate planning strategies for achieving bal\\xad\\nance between these costs. These strategies involve trade-offs among capital investment, \\nworkforce size, work hours, inventory, and backlogs/lost sales. Most strategies that a \\nplanner actually uses are a combination of these three and are referred to as tailored \\nstrategies. The three strategies are as follows. \\n1. Chase strategy-using capacity as the lever: With this strategy, the production rate \\nis synchronized with the demand rate by varying machine capacity or hiring and laying \\n----------'),\n",

In practice, achieving this synchronization can \\nbe very problematic because of the difficulty of varying capacity and workforce on \\nshort notice. This strategy can be expensive to implement if the cost of varying machine \\nor labor capacity over time is high. It can also have a significant negative impact on the \\nmorale of the workforce. The chase strategy results in low levels of inventory in the sup\\xad\\nply chain and high levels of change in capacity and workforce. It should be used when \\nthe cost of carrying inventory is very high and costs to change levels of machine and \\nlabor capacity are low. \\n2. Time flexibility from workforce or capacity strategy-using utilization as the lever: \\nThis strategy may be used if there is excess machine capacity (i.e., if machines are not \\nused 24 hours a day, seven days a week). In this case the workforce (capacity) is kept \\nstable but the number of hours worked is varied over time in an effort to synchro\\xad\\nnize production with demand. A planner can use variable amounts of overtime or a \\nflexible schedule to achieve this synchronization. Although this strategy does \\nrequire that the workforce be flexible, it avoids some of the problems associated \\nwith the chase strategy, most notably, changing the size of the workforce. This strat\\xad\\negy results in low levels of inventory but with lower average machine utilization. It \\nshould be used when inventory carrying costs are relatively high and machine \\ncapacity is relatively inexpensive. \\n3. Level strategy-using inventory as the lever: With this strategy, a stable machine \\ncapacity and workforce are maintained with a constant output rate. Shortages and sur\\xad\\npluses result in inventory levels fluctuating over time. In this case, production is not \\nsynchronized with demand. Either inventories are built up in anticipation of future \\ndemand or backlogs are carried over from high-to low-demand periods. Employees \\nbenefit from stable working conditions. A drawback associated with this strategy is that \\nlarge inventories may accumulate and customer orders may be delayed. This strategy \\nkeeps capacity and costs of changing capacity relatively low. It should be used when \\ninventory carrying and backlog costs are relatively low. \\nIn the next section, we discuss a methodology that is commonly used for aggregate \\nplanning. \\n8.4 AGGREGATE PLANNING USING LINEAR PROGRAMMING \\nAs we discussed earlier, the goal of aggregate planning is to maximize profit while \\nmeeting demand. Every company, in its effort to meet customer demand, faces certain \\nconstraints, such as the capacity of its facilities or a supplier's ability to deliver a com\\xad\\nponent. A highly effective tool for a company to use when it tries to maximize profits \\nwhile being subjected to a series of constraints is linear programming. Linear program\\xad\\nming finds the solution that creates the highest profit while satisfying the constraints \\nthat the company faces. \\nWe illustrate linear programming through the discussion of Red Tomato Tools, a \\nsmall manufacturer of gardening equipment with manufacturing facilities in Mexico. \\nRed Tomato's products are sold through retailers in the United States. Red Tomato's \\noperations consist of the assembly of purchased parts into a multipurpose gardening \\ntool. Because of the limited equipment and space required for its assembly operations, \\nRed Tomato's capacity is determined mainly by the size of its workforce. \\nFor this example, we use a six-month time period because this is a long enough \\ntime horizon to illustrate many of the main points of aggregate planning.\"),\n",

This seasonal demand ripples up \\nthe supply chain from the retailer to Red Tomato, the manufacturer. Red Tomato has \\ndecided to use aggregate planning to overcome the obstacle of seasonal demand and \\nmaximize profits. The options Red Tomato has for handling the seasonality are adding \\nworkers during the peak season, subcontracting out some of the work, building up \\ninventory during the slow months, or building up a backlog of orders that will be deliv\\xad\\nered late to customers. To determine how to best use these options through an aggregate \\nplan, Red Tomato's vice president of supply chain starts with the first task-building a \\ndemand forecast. Although Red Tomato could attempt to forecast this demand itself, a \\nmuch more accurate forecast comes from a collaborative process used by both Red \\nTomato and its retailers to produce the forecast shown in Table 8-1. \\nRed Tomato sells each tool to the retailers for $40. The company has a starting \\ninventory in January of 1,000 tools. At the beginning of January the company has a \\nworkforce of 80 employees. The plant has a total of 20 working days in each month, and \\neach employee earns $4 per hour regular time. Each employee works eight hours per \\nday on straight time and the rest on overtime.

For now, given Red Tomato's desire for a very high level of \\ncustomer service, assume all demand is to be met, although it can be met late. \\nTherefore, the revenues earned over the planning horizon are fixed. As a result, mini\\xad\\nmizing cost over the planning horizon is the same as maximizing profit. In many \\ninstances, a company has the option of not meeting certain demand, or price itself may \\nbe a variable that a company has to determine based on the aggregate plan. In such a \\nscenario, minimizing cost is not equivalent to maximizing profits. \\nDECISION VARIABLES \\nThe first step in constructing an aggregate planning model is to identify the set of deci\\xad\\nsion variables whose values are to be determined as part of the aggregate plan. For \\nRed Tomato, the following decision variables are defined for the aggregate planning \\nmodel: \\nWr = workforce size for Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nRt = number of employees hired at the beginning of Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nLr =number of employees laid off at the beginning of Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nPt = number of units produced in Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nIt = inventory at the end of Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nSt = number of units stocked out/backlogged at the end of Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nCt = number of units subcontracted for Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nOt =number of overtime hours worked in Month t, t = 1, ... , 6 \\nThe next step in constructing an aggregate planning model is to define the objective \\nfunction. \\nOBJECTIVE FUNCTION \\nDenote the demand in Period t by Dt. The values of Dt are as specified by the demand \\nforecast in Table 8-1. The objective function is to minimize the total cost (equivalent to \\nmaximizing total profit as all demand is to be satisfied) incurred during the planning \\nhorizon. The cost incurred has the following components: \\n• Regular-time labor cost \\n• Overtime labor cost \\n• Cost of hiring and layoffs \\n• Cost of holding inventory \\n• Cost of stocking out \\n• Cost of subcontracting \\n• Material cost \\nThese costs are evaluated as follows: \\n1. Regular-time labor .cost. Recall that workers are paid a regular-time wage of \\n$640 ($4/hour X 8 hours/day X 20 days/month) per month. Because Wt is the number \\nof workers in Period t, the regular-time labor cost over the planning horizon is given by \\n6 \\nRegular-time labor cost = 2:640Wt \\nt=l\"),\n",

Capacity constraints. In each period, the amount produced cannot exceed the avail\\xad\\nable capacity. This set of constraints limits the total production by the total internally \\navailable capacity (which is determined based on the available labor hours, regular or \\novertime). Subcontracted production is not included in this constraint because the con\\xad\\nstraint is limited to production within the plant. As each worker can produce 40 units \\nper month on regular time (four hours per unit as specified in Table 8-2) and one unit \\nfor every four hours of overtime, we have the following: \\nOc \\nPc :5 40Wc + 4 for t = 1, ... ,6 (8.3) \\n3. Inventory balance constraints. The third set of constraints balances inventory at \\nthe end of each period. Net demand for Period tis obtained as the sum of the current \\ndemand D t and the previous backlog Sc_1. This demand is either filled from current \\nproduction (in-house production Pc or subcontracted production Cc) and previous \\ninventory lc_1 (in which case some inventory Ic may be left over) or part of it is back\\xad\\nlogged Sc. This relationship is captured by the following equation: \\nfor t = 1, ...

Overtime limit constraints. The fourth set of constraints requires that no employee \\nwork more than 10 hours of overtime each month. This requirement limits the total \\namount of overtime hours available as follows: \\nfor t = 1, ... '6 (8.5) \\nIn addition, each variable must be nonnegative and there must be no backlog at \\nthe end of Period 6 (i.e., S6 = 0). \\nWhen implementing the model in Microsoft Excel, which we discuss later, it is eas\\xad\\niest if all the constraints are written so that the right-hand side for each constraint is 0. \\nThe overtime limit constraint (Equation 8.5) in this form is written as \\nfor t = 1, ...

Today, ~orne planning modules incorporate nonlinear optimization to \\naccount for the fact that not all constraints or reasonable objective functions are linear \\nfunctions. However, given the large amount of data considered in producing aggregate \\nplans, which can render nonlinear problems computationally prohibitive, and the abil\\xad\\nity to create linear approximations of nonlinear functions, linear programming is often \\nthe best way to solve these problems. \\nSupply chain planning modules today often combine both production planning \\nand inventory planning. The supply chain planning module uses the output of the fore\\xad\\ncasting module as a constraint in setting up the production schedule and inventory lev\\xad\\nels. These production schedules and inventory levels are used by the execution system \\nfor the actual production of the goods and the setting of inventory levels throughout \\nthe supply chain. Given the complexity of the problem, aggregate planning modules \\ncan add significant value even for small companies. \\nThere are a number of dimensions along which IT can add value in the aggregate \\nplanning realm: \\n• The ability to handle large problems \\n• The ability to handle complex problems (through either nonlinear optimization \\nor linear approximations) \\n• The ability to interact with other core IT systems such as inventory management \\nand sourcing \\nBecause aggregate planning problems are so complex, there is often no other way \\nto arrive at a feasible solution than through IT. \\nMajor software players in this area include the ERP software firms (SAP and \\nOracle) and the best-of-breed players (such as i2 Technologies and Manugistics). Some \\nfirms also specialize their planning software by industry verticals. For example, the pro\\xad\\nduction planning problems for an oil company are structured differently than those for \\nan aircraft manufacturer. These differences allow IT firms to enhance the value of their \\nproduct by focusing on particular industries. \\nIMPLEMENTING AGGREGATE PLANNING IN PRACTICE \\n1. Think beyond the enterprise to the entire supply chain. Most aggregate planning \\ntoday takes only the enterprise as its breadth of scope. However, many factors outside \\nthe enterprise throughout the supply chain can affect the optimal aggregate plan dra\\xad\\nmatically. Therefore, avoid the trap of thinking only about your enterprise when plan\\xad\\nning. Work with downstream partners to produce forecasts, with upstream partners to \\ndetermine constraints, and with any other supply chain entities that can improve the \\nquality of the inputs into the aggregate plan. The plan is only as good as the quality of \\nthe inputs. So using the supply chain to increase the quality of the inputs will greatly \\nimprove the quality of the aggregate plan. Also make sure to communicate the aggre\\xad\\ngate plan to all supply chain partners who will be affected by it. \\n2. Make plans flexible, because forecasts are always wrong. Aggregate plans are based \\non forecasts of future demand. Given that these forecasts are always wrong to some \\ndegree, the aggregate plan needs to have some flexibility built into it if it is to be useful. By \\nbuilding flexibility into the plan, when future demand changes, or other changes occur \\nsuch as increases in costs, the plan can adjust appropriately to handle the new situation.· \\n··--------------'),\n",

In addition to the suggestions earlier in the chapter, \\nwe recommend that a manager perform sensitivity analysis on the inputs into an aggregate \\nplan. For example, if the plan recommends expanding expensive capacity while facing \\nuncertain demand, examine the outcome of a new aggregate plan when demand is higher \\nand when it is lower than expected. If this examination reveals a small savings from \\nexpanding capacity when demand is high but a large increase in cost when demand is \\nlower than expected, deciding to postpone the capacity investment decision is a potentially \\nattractive option. Using sensitivity analysis on the inputs into the aggregate plan enables a \\nplanner to choose the best solution for the range of possibilities that could oocur. \\n3. Rerun the aggregate plan as new data emerge. As we have mentioned, aggregate \\nplans provide a map for the next 3 to 18 months. This does not mean that a firm should \\nrun aggregate plans only once every 3 to 18 months. As inputs such as demand fore\\xad\\ncasts change, managers should use the latest values of these inputs and rerun the aggre\\xad\\ngate plan. By using the latest inputs, the plan will avoid suboptimization based on old \\ndata and will produce a better solution. \\n4. Use aggregate planning as capacity utilization increases. Surprisingly, many compa\\xad\\nnies do not create aggregate plans and instead rely solely on orders from their distrib\\xad\\nutors or warehouses to determine their production schedules. These orders are driven \\neither by actual demand or through inventory management algorithms. If a company \\nhas no trouble meeting demand efficiently this way, then the lack of aggregate planning \\nmay not harm the company significantly. However, when utilization becomes high and \\ncapacity is an issue, relying on orders to set the production schedule can lead to capac\\xad\\nity problems. When utilization is high, the likelihood of producing for all the orders as \\nthey arrive is very low. Planning needs to be done to best utilize the capacity to meet \\nthe forecasted demand. Therefore, as capacity utilization increases, it becomes more \\nimportant to perform aggregate planning. \\n8.8 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Identify the decisions that are best solved by aggregate planning. \\nAggregate planning is best used to determine capacity, production, and inventory deci\\xad\\nsions for each period of time over a range of three to 18 months. It is most important to per\\xad\\nform aggregate planning when capacity is limited and lead times are long. \\n2. Ynderstand the importance of aggregate planning as a supply chain activity. \\nAggregate planning has a significant impact on supply chain performance and must be \\nviewed as an activity that involves all supply chain partners. An aggregate plan prepared by \\nan enterprise in isolation is not very useful because it does not take into account all require\\xad\\nments of the customer stage and constraints from the supplier stage. Localized aggregate \\nplanning cannot do a good job of matching supply and demand. Good aggregate planning is \\ndone in collaboration with both customers and suppliers because accurate input is required \\nfrom both stages. The quality of these inputs, in terms of both the demand forecast to be met \\nand the constraints to be dealt with, determines the quality of the aggregate plan. The results \\nof the aggregate plan must also be shared across the supply chain because they influence \\nactivities at both customers and suppliers. For suppliers, the aggregate plan determines antic\\xad\\nipated orders; whereas for customers, the aggregate plan determines planned supply. \\n3. Describe the information needed to produce an aggregate plan. \\nTo create an aggregate plan, a planner needs a demand forecast, cost and production \\ninformation, and any supply constraints. The demand forecast consists of an estimate of \\ndemand for each period of time in the planning horizon. The production and cost data'),\n",

Polystyrene is pur\\xad\\nchased as a commodity in the form of resin pellets. The \\nresin is unloaded from bulk rail containers or overland \\ntrailers into storage silos. Making the food containers is a \\ntwo-step process. In the first step, resin is conveyed to an \\nextruder, which turns pellets into a polystyrene sheet that \\nis wound into rolls. The plastic comes in two forms-clear \\nand black. The rolls are then either used immediately to \\nmake containers or are put into storage. In the second \\nstep, the rolls are loaded onto thermoforming presses, \\nwhich form the sheet into container cavities and trim the \\ncavities from the sheet. These manufacturing steps are \\nshown in Figure 7-1. SPC currently operates for 63 work\\xad\\ning days each quarter. Each work day consists of eight \\nhours of regular time and any scheduled overtime. \\nDEMAND FORECAST FOR NEXT \\nTHREE YEARS \\nThe collaborative forecasting team used the historical \\ndemand data provided in Table 7-4 supplemented with \\nstockout data to develop a forecast for quarterly demand \\nfor both clear and black plastic containers. The demand \\nforecast between 2007 and 2009 is shown in Table 8-9. \\nEXTRUDERS \\nThe extrusion process is capital intensive, as is the invest\\xad\\nment in the facilities required to support it. The plant \\ncurrently has 14 extruders. Each extruder has a rated pro\\xad\\ncessing capacity of 3,000 pounds per hour. A changeover \\nis required whenever the extruder switches between clear \\nand black sheets. SPC estimates that there is a 5 percent \\ncapacity loss due to changeovers. The effective processing \\ncapacity of an extruder is thus 2,850 pounds per hour. \\n238 \\nEach extruder requires six workers. SPC pays each \\nworker $15 per hour including benefits. Overtime is paid \\nat 150 percent of regular-time salary. Workers are limited \\nto 60 overtime hours per quarter. \\nExtruders are fairly expensive, and the addition of \\nan extruder requires the hiring of six additional people. \\nEach new extruder incurs a fixed cost of $80,000 per \\nquarter. Any new personnel hired need to be trained. \\nTraining cost per person is $3,000. As a result, SPC has \\ndecided not to purchase any new extruders over the cur\\xad\\nrent planning horizon. During any quarter, available \\nextruders may be idled if they are not to be used. The \\nonly savings here is the salary of associated workers. \\nLaying off each worker, however, costs $2,500. If idled \\nextruders are brought online, SPC incurs a training cost \\nof $3,000 per worker. \\nTHERMOFORMING PRESSES \\nThe plant currently has 25 thermoforming presses. Each \\nthermoforming press requires one operator and can pro\\xad\\nduce containers at the rate of 2,000 pounds per hour. SPC \\npays each operator $15 per hour including benefits. \\nOvertime is paid at 150 percent of regular-time salary. \\nWorkers are limited to 60 hours of overtime per quarter. \\nPresses may be idled for the quarter if they are not to be \\nused. Laying off a thermoforming operator costs $2,500, \\nand training a newly hired bperator costs $3,000. \\nSUBCONTRACTING \\nSPC has the option of subcontracting the production of \\nplastic sheets to one of its supply chain partners; suffi\\xad\\ncient capacity is always available on the open market. \\nSPC spends $60 per 1,000 pounds of plastic sheet pro\\xad\\nduced by a subcontractor. \\nMATERIALS MANAGEMENT \\nPRACTICES \\nResin purchased is stored in silos. As there is no shortage \\nof resin in the market, it can easily be purchased at $10 \\nper 1,000 pounds when needed. As a result, SPC's prac\\xad\\ntice has been to purchase resin on a quarterly basis to \\nmatch the planned production. \\nAs the extruders produce rolls of plastic sheet, the \\namount required at the thermoforming presses is passed \\nforward, with the rest driven via shuttle trailer to one of \\ntwo public warehouses, Transportation is again required \\nto bring the sheets back from the warehouse when they\"),\n",

The SPC plant contracts with local \\nwarehouses to store material on a per-thousand-pound \\nbasis. Material handling charges are from $4 to $6 per \\n1,000 pounds unloaded at the warehouse. Storage \\ncharges are from $10 to $12 per 1,000 pounds in storage \\nat the end of each quarter. The SPC plant negotiates \\nannually with local warehouses to establish rates for each \\ncost element. \\nPRIVATE WAREHOUSING \\nOperating a private warehouse requires capitalized \\ninvestment either to construct a facility or to lease an \\nexisting facility. Lease rates in any location are deter\\xad\\nmined by the economics associated with building costs in \\nthat location and the option value of. a lease versus a \\nlong-term capital commitment. Leases are typically in \\nforce for three years, but the time span can be shorter \\ndepending on a given company's negotiating strengths. \\nSeveral viable leasing options exist for the SPC plant, all \\nmore favorable than the option of building a new facility. \\nLease rates average $4 per square foot per quarter in \\nL_ .. \\neach location. On average, one square foot is required per \\n1,000 pounds in storage. \\nPrivate warehousing also results in operating costs, \\nboth variable and fixed. Private warehousing is avail\\xad\\nable from a third-party logistics provider who has \\nagreed to charge SPC a variable operating cost of $4 per \\n1,000 pounds of plastic sheet stored per quarter. To \\nobtain this rate, SPC must sign a lease for the full three \\nyears. As a result, SPC will pay for the space each quarter \\neven if it is not used for storage. SPC must take this cost \\ninto account when making its decision. \\nSPC must consider several variables in determining \\nthe amount of warehouse space it requires. Usable ware\\xad\\nhousing space is the fraction of a warehouse that can \\nactually be used to store inventory. Considerations are \\nmade for aisle space, shipping and receiving dock space, \\nadministrative office space, and ceiling height. Storage \\ndensity is another consideration. SPC must also take into \\naccount velocity and times of materials movement \\nbecause the staffing level required and storage configura\\xad\\ntions are dependent on both. For example, if materials \\nmust be retrieved readily, the warehouse layout must \\ninclude a greater ratio of aisle and staging space to actual \\nstorage space. \\nTHE ACTIONS AND DECISIONS \\nJulie and her group must take two actions. The first, given \\na three-year forecast as shown in Table 8-7, is to come up \\nwith an aggregate production plan. The second is to \\nchoose from the following three options: \\n1.

For products with stable demand, devising an aggregate plan is rela\\xad\\ntively simple. In such cases, a firm arranges for sufficient capacity to match the ex\\xad\\npected demand and then produces an amount to match that demand. Products can be \\nproduced close to the time when they will be sold. Therefore, the supply chain carries \\nlittle inventory. \\nDemand for many products, however, changes frequently from period to period, \\noften because of a predictable influence. These influences include seasonal factors that \\naffect products (e.g., lawn mowers and ski jackets), as well as nonseasonal factors (e.g., \\npromotions or product adoption rates) that may cause large, predictable increases and \\ndeclines in sales. \\nPredictable variability is change in demand that can be forecasted. Products that \\nundergo this type of change in demand create numerous problems in the supply chain, \\nranging from high levels of stockouts during peak demand periods to high levels of \\nexcess inventory during periods of low demand. These problems increase the costs and'),\n",

Supply and demand management has \\nsignificant impact when applied to predictably variable products. \\nFaced with predictable variability, a company's goal is to respond in a manner that \\nmaximizes profitability. A firm must choose between two broad options to handle pre\\xad\\ndictable variability: \\n1. Manage supply using capacity, inventory, subcontracting, and backlogs. \\n2. Manage demand using short-term price discounts and trade promotions. \\nThe use of these tools enables the supply chain to increase profitability, because \\nsupply and demand are matched in a more coordinated fashion. \\nTo illustrate some of the issues involved, let us consider the garden equipment \\nmanufacturer discussed in Chapter 8, Red Tomato Tools. Demand for garden tools is \\nseasonal, with sales concentrated in the spring. Red Tomato must plan how it will meet \\nthe demand to maximize profit. One way requires Red Tomato to carry enough manu\\xad\\nfacturing capacity to meet demand from production in any period. The advantage of \\nthis approach is that Red Tomato incurs very low inventory costs because no inventory \\nis carried from period to period. The disadvantage, however, is that much of the expen\\xad\\nsive capacity is unused during most months, when demand is lower. \\nAnother approach to meeting demand is to build up inventory during the off-season \\nto keep production stable year round. The advantage of this approach lies in the fact Red \\nTomato can get by with a lower-capacity, less expensive factory. High inventory carrying \\ncosts, however, make this alternative expensive. A third approach is for Red Tomato to \\nwork with its retail partners in the supply chain to offer a price promotion before the \\nspring months, during periods of low demand. This promotion shifts some of the spring \\ndemand forward into a slow period, thereby spreading demand more evenly throughout \\nthe year and reducing the seasonal surge. Such a demand pattern is less expensive to sup\\xad\\nply. Red Tomato needs to decide which alternative maximizes its profitability. \\nOften companies divide the task of supply and demand management into different \\nfunctions. Marketing typically manages demand, while Operations manages supply. At \\na higher level, supply chains suffer from this phenomenon as well, with retailers man\\xad\\naging demand independently and manufacturers managing supply independently. Lack \\nof coordination hurts supply chain profits when supply and demand management deci\\xad\\nsions are made independently. Therefore, supply chain partners must work together \\nacross enterprises to coordinate these decisions and maximize, profitability. We illus\\xad\\ntrate the value of this coordination through further discussion of Red Tomato. \\nFirst, we focus on actions that a supply chain can take to improve profitability by \\nmanaging supply. \\n9.2 MANAGING SUPPLY \\nA firm can vary supply of product by controlling a combination of the following two \\nfactors: \\n1. Production capacity \\n2. Inventory \\nThe objective is to maximize profit, which, for our discussion, is the difference \\nbetween revenue generated from sales and the total cost associated with material, . \\ncapacity, and inventory.

In the following, we list some specific approaches to \\nmanaging capacity and inventory with the goal of maximizing profits . \\n. ---------· ----\"),\n",

In many instances, plants do \\nnot operate continually and are left idle during portions of the day or week. Therefore, \\nspare plant capacity exists in the form of hours when the plant is not operational. For \\nexample, many plants do not run three shifts, so the existing workforce could work \\noyertime during peak periods to produce more to meet demand. The overtime is varied \\nto match the fluctuation in demand. This system allows production from the plant to \\nmatch demand from customers more closely. If demand fluctuates by day of the week \\nor week of the month and the workforce is willing to be flexible, a firm may schedule \\nthe workforce so that the available capacity matches demand better. In such settings, \\nuse of a part-time workforce may further increase capacity flexibility by enabling the \\nfirm to put more people to work during peak periods. Telemarketing centers and banks \\nuse part-time workers extensively to match supply and demand better. \\n• Use of seasonal workforce: In this approach, a firm uses a temporary workforce during \\nthe peak season to increase capacity to match demand. The tourism industry often uses \\nseasonal workers. A base of full-time employees exists, and more are hired only for the \\npeak season. Toyota regularly uses seasonal workforce in Japan to match supply and \\ndemand better. This approach, however, may be hard to sustain if the labor market is tight. \\n• Use of subcontracting: In this approach, a firm subcontracts peak production so that \\ninternal production remains level and can be done cheaply. With the subcontractor \\nhandling the peaks, the company is able to build a relatively inflexible but low-cost \\nfacility in which production rates are kept relatively constant (other than variations \\nfrom the use of overtime). Peaks are subcontracted out to facilities that are more flex\\xad\\nible. A key here is the availability of relatively flexible subcontractor capacity. The sub\\xad\\ncontractor can often provide flexibility at a lower cost by pooling the fluctuations in \\ndemand across different manufacturers. Thus the flexible subcontractor capacity must \\nhave both volume (fluctuating demand from a manufacturer) as well as variety flexi\\xad\\nbility (demand from several manufacturers) to be sustainable. For example, most \\npower companies do not have the capacity to supply their customers with all the elec\\xad\\ntricity demanded on peak days. They instead rely on being able to purchase power \\nfrom suppliers and subcontractors who have excess electricity. This allows the power \\ncompanies !O maintain a level supply and, consequently, a lower cost. \\n• Use of dual facilities-specialized and flexible: In this approach, a firm builds both \\nspecialized and flexible facilities. Specialized facilities produce a relatively stable out\\xad\\nput of products over time in a very efficient manner. Flexible facilities produce a \\nwidely varying volume and variety of products but at a higher unit cost. For instance, a \\nPC components manufacturer might have specialized facilities for each type of circuit \\nboard as well as a flexible facility that can manufacture all types of circuit boards. Each \\nspecialized facility can produce at a relatively steady rate, with fluctuations being \\nabsorbed by the flexible facility. \\n• Designing product flexibility into the production processes: In this approach, a firm \\nhas flexible production lines whose production rate can easily be varied. Production is \\nthen changed to match demand. Hino Trucks in Japan has several production lines for \\ndifferent product families. The production lines are designed so that changing the num\\xad\\nber of workers on a line can vary the production rate. As long as variation of demand \\nacross different product lines is complementary (i.e., when one goes up, the other tends'),\n",

Of course, this requires that the workforce be multiskilled and adapt \\neasily to being moved from line to line. Production flexibility can also be achieved if \\nthe production machinery is flexible and can be changed easily from producing one \\nproduct to producing another. This approach is effective only if the overall demand \\nacross all the products is relatively constant. Several firms that produce products with \\nseasonal demand try to exploit this approach by carrying a portfolio of products that \\nhave peak demand seasons distributed over the year. A classic example is that of a \\nlawn mower manufacturer that also manufactures snow blowers to maintain a steady \\ndemand on its factory throughout the year. In the services field, an example comes \\nfrom strategy consulting firms, which often offer a balanced product portfolio, with \\ngrowth strategies emphasized when economic times are good and cost-cutting projects \\nemphasized when times are bad. \\nMANAGING INVENTORY \\nWhen managing inventory to meet predictable variability, firms use a combination of \\nthe following approaches. \\n• Using common components across multiple products: In this approach, a firm designs \\ncommon components to be used in multiple products. The total demand of these com\\xad\\nponents is relatively stable, even though each product displays predictable variability. \\nFor example, the use of a common engine for both lawn mowers and snow blowers \\nallows for engine demand to be relatively stable even though lawn mower and snow \\nblower demand fluctuates over the year. Therefore, the part of the supply chain that \\nproduces components can easily synchronize supply with demand, and a relatively low \\ninventory of parts has to be built up. Similarly, in a consulting firm, many of the same \\nconsultants produce growth strategies when they are in demand and produce cost\\xad\\nreduction strategies when these are in demand. \\n• Build inventory of high-demand or predictable-demand products: When most of the \\nproducts a firm produces have the same peak demand season, the previous approach is \\nnot feasible. In such an environment, it is best for the firm to build products that have \\nmore predictable demand during the off-season, because there is less to be learned \\nabout their demand by waiting. Production of more uncertain items should take place \\ncloser to the selling season, when demand is more predictable. As an example, consider \\na manufacturer of winter jackets that produces jackets both for retail sale and for the \\nBost9n Police and Fire Departments. Demand for the Boston Police and Fire jackets is \\nmore predictable, and these jackets can be made in the off-season and stocked up until \\nwinter. The retail jacket's demand, however, will likely be better known closer to the \\ntime when it is sold, because fashion trends can change quickly. Therefore, the manufac\\xad\\nturer should produce the retail jackets close to the peak season, when demand is easier \\nto predict. This strategy helps the supply chain synchronize supply and demand better. \\nNext we consider actions a supply chain can take to improve profitability by man\\xad\\naging demand. \\n9.3 MANAGING DEMAND \\nSupply chains can influence demand by using pricing, and other forms of promotion. \\nPromotion decisions are often made by retailers without taking into account the \\nimpact on the rest of the supply chain.

Green \\nThumb Gardens is a large retail chain that has signed an exclusive contract to sell all \\nproducts made by Red Tomato Tools. Demand for garden tools peaks in the spring \\nmonths of March and April as gardeners prepare to begin planting. In planning, the \\ngoal of both firms should be to maximize supply chain profits because this outcome \\nleaves them more money to share. For profit maximization to take place, Red Tomato \\nand Green Thumb need to devise a way to collaborate and, just as important, deter\\xad\\nmine a way to split the supply chain profits. Determining how these profits will be allo\\xad\\ncated to different members of the supply chain is key to successful collaboration. \\nRed Tomato and Green Thumb are exploring how the timing of retail promotions \\naffects profitability. Are they in a better position if they offer the price promotion dur\\xad\\ning the peak period of demand or during a low-demand period? Green Thumb's vice \\npresident of sales favors a promotion during the peak period because this increases \\nrevenue by the largest amount. In contrast, Red Tomato's vice president of manufac\\xad\\nturing is against such a move because it increases manufacturing costs. She favors a \\npromotion during the low-demand season because it levels demand and lowers pro\\xad\\nduction costs. \\nRed Tomato and Green Thumb must start by considering the demand forecast \\nshown in Table 9-1 and the resulting optimal aggregate plan (this is the same as dis\\xad\\ncussed in Chapter 8). \\nEach tool has a retail price of $40. Red Tomato ships assembled tools to Green \\nThumb, where all inventory is held. Green Thumb has a starting inventory in January \\nof 1,000 tools. At the beginning of January, Red Tomato has a workforce of 80 employ\\xad\\nees at its manufacturing facility in Mexico. There are a total of 20 working days in each \\nmonth, and Red Tomato workers earn the equivalent of $4 per hour. Each employee \\nworks eight hours on normal time and the rest on overtime. Because the Red Tomato \\noperation consists mostly of hand assembly, the capacity of the production operation is \\ndetermined primarily by the total labor hours worked (i.e., it is not limited by machine \\ncapacity). No employee works more than 10 hours of overtime per month. The various \\ncosts are shown in Table 9-2. \\nThere are no limits on subcontracting, inventories, and stockouts.

They start by consider\\xad\\ning the impact of promotion on demand. When a promotion is offered during a period, \\nthat period's demand tends to go up. This increase in demand results from a combina\\xad\\ntion of the following three factors: \\n1. Market growth: An increase in consumption of the product either from new or exist\\xad\\ning customers. For example, when Toyota offers a price promotion on the Camry, it may \\nattract buyers who were considering the purchase of a lower-end model. Thus, the \\npromotion increases the size of the overall family sedan market as well as increasing \\nToyota's sales. \\n2. Stealing share: Customers substitute the firm's product for a competitor's product. \\nWhen Toyota offers a Camry promotion, buyers who might have purchased a Honda \\nAccord may now purchase a Camry. Thus, the promotion increases Toyota's sales while \\nkeeping the overall size of the family sedan market the same. \\n3. Forward buying: Customers move up future purchases (as discussed in Chapter 10) \\nto the present. A promotion may attract buyers who would have purchased a Camry a \\nfew months down the road. The promotion does not increase Toyota's sales in the long \\nrun and also leaves the family sedan market the same size. \\nThe first two factors increase the overall demand for Toyota, whereas the third \\nsimply shifts future demand to the present. It is important to understand the relative \\nimpact from the three factors as a result of a promotion before making a decision \\nregarding the optimal timing of the promotion. In general, as the fraction of increased \\ndemand coming from forward buying grows, offering the promotion during the peak \\ndemand period becomes less attractive. Offering a promotion during a peak period \\nthat has significant forward buying creates even more variable demand than before the \\npromotion. Product that was once demanded in the slow period is now demanded in \\nthe peak period, making this demand pattern even more costly to serve. \\nGreen Thumb estimates that discounting a Red Tomato tool from $40 to $39 (a $1 \\ndiscount) results in the period demand increasing by 10 percent because of increased \\nconsumption or substitution. Further, 20 percent of each of the two following months' \\ndemand is moved forward. Management would like to d~termine whether it is more \\neffective to offer the discount in January or April. \\nThe team first considers the impact of offering the discount in January.

Coordinate planning across enterprises in the supply chain. For a supply chain to \\nmanage predictable variability successfully, the entire chain must work toward the \\none goal of maximizing profitability. Every member of a supply chain may agree with \\nthis in principal. In reality, however, it is very difficult for an entire supply chain to \\nagree on how to maximize profitability. Firms have even had trouble getting different \\nfunctions within an enterprise to plan collaboratively. Incentives play a large role in \\nthis. Within a company, marketing often has incentives based on revenue, whereas \\noperations has incentives based on cost. Within a supply chain, different enterprises \\nare judged by their own profitability, not necessarily by the overall supply chain's \\nprofitability. From the examples considered earlier, it is clear that without a focus on \\ngetting companies to work together, a supply chain will return suboptimal profits. \\nCollaboration should occur through the formation of joint teams. Incentives of the \\nmembers of a supply chain must be aligned. High-level support within an organization \\nis needed because this coordination often requires groups to act against their tradi\\xad\\ntional operating procedures. Although this collaboration is difficult, the payoffs are \\nsignificant. \\n2. Take predictable variability into account when making strategic decisions. \\nPredictable variability has a tremendous impact on the operations of a company. A \\nfirm must always take this impact into account when making strategic decisions. \\nHowever, predictable variability is not always taken into account when strategic plans \\nare made, such as what type of products to offer, whether or not to build new facilities, \\nand what sort of pricing structure a company should have. As indicated in this chapter, \\nthe level of profitability is greatly affected by predictable variability and, therefore, the \\nsuccess or failure of strategic decisions can be determined by it. \\n3. Preempt, do not just react to, predictable variability. Companies often have a ten\\xad\\ndency to focus on how they can react effectively to predictable variability. This responsi\\xad\\nbility often falls on operations, which tries to manage supply to deal best with predictable \\nvariability. As discussed in this chapter, the management of supply as well as demand \\nprovides the best response to predictable variability. Actions such as pricing and promo\\xad\\ntion that manage demand are preemptive and often in the domain of marketing. It is \\nimportant for marketing and operations to coordinate their efforts and plan for pre\\xad\\ndictable variability together well before the peak demand is observed. This coordina\\xad\\ntion -allows a firm to preempt predictable variability and come up with a response that \\nmaximizes profits. \\n9.5 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Manage supply to improve synchronization in a supply chain in the face of predictable \\nvariability. \\nTo manage supply with the goal of maximizing profit, companies must manage their \\ncapacity through the use of workforce flexibility, subcontracting, dual facilities, and product \\nflexibility. Companies must also manage supply through the use of inventory by emphasizing \\ncommon parts and building and holding products with predictable demand ahead of time. \\nThese methodologies, combined with aggregate planning, enable a company to manage sup\\xad\\nply effectively.\"),\n",

Lavare, located in the Chicago suburbs, is a major manufacturer of stainless steel sinks. \\nLavare is in the middle of the demand and supply planning exercise for the coming year. \\nAnticipated monthly demand from distributors over the 12 months is shown in Table 9-14. \\nCapacity at Lavare is governed by the number of machine operators it hires.

Devise appropriate discounting schemes for a supply chain. \\n4. Understand the impact of trade promotions on lot size and cycle inventory. \\n5. Identify managerial levers that reduce lot size and cycle inventory in a supply chain without \\nincreasing cost. \\nC\\nycle inventory exists because producing or purchasing in large lots allows a stage \\nof the supply chain to exploit economies of scale and thus lower cost. The presence \\nof fixed costs associated with ordering and transportation, quantity discounts in prod\\xad\\nuct pricing, and short-term discounts or trade promotions encourages different stages \\nof a supply chain to exploit economies of scale and order in large lots. In this chapter, \\nwe study how each of these factors affects the lot size and cycle inventories within a \\nsupply chain. Our goal is to identify managerial levers that reduce cycle inventory in a \\nsupply chain without raising cost. \\n10.1 THE ROLE OF CYCLE INVENTORY IN \\nA SUPPLY CHAIN \\nA lot or batch size is the quantity that a stage of a supply chain either produces or pur\\xad\\nchases at a time. Consider, for example, a computer store that sells an average of four \\nprinters a day. The store manager, however, orders 80 printers from the manufacturer \\neach time he places an order. The lot or batch size in this case is 80 printers. Given daily \\nsales of four printers, it takes an average of 20 days before the store sells the entire lot \\nand purchases a replenishment lot. The computer store holds an inventory of printers \\nbecause the manager purchases a lot size larger than the store's daily sales. Cycle \\ninventory is the average inventory in a supply chain due to either production or pur\\xad\\nchases in lot sizes that are larger than those demanded by the customer. \\nIn the rest of this chapter we use the following notation: \\nQ: Quantity in a lot or batch size \\nD: Demand per unit time\"),\n",

In Chapter 11, we introduce demand variability and its impact on \\nsafety inventory. \\nLet us consider the cycle inventory of jeans at Jean-Mart, a department store. The \\ndemand for jeans is relatively stable at D = 100 pairs of jeans per day. The store man\\xad\\nager at Jean-Mart currently purchases in lots of Q = 1,000 pairs. The inventory profile \\nof jeans at Jean-Mart is a plot depicting the level of inventory over time, as shown in \\nFigure 10-1. \\nBecause purchases are in lots of Q = 1,000 units, whereas demand is only D = \\n100 units per day, it takes 10 days for an entire lot to be sold. Over these 10 days, the \\ninventory of jeans at Jean-Mart declines steadily from 1,000 units (when the lot \\narrives) to 0 (when the last pair is sold). This sequence of a lot arriving and demand \\ndepleting inventory until another lot arrives repeats itself every 10 days, as shown in \\nthe inventory profile in Figure 10-1. \\nWhen demand is steady, cycle inventory and lot size are related as follows: \\n. lot size \\nCycle mventory = 2 \\nQ \\n2 \\n(10.1) \\nFor a lot size of 1,000 units, Jean-Mart carries a cycle inventory of Q/2 = 500 pairs \\nof jeans. From Equation 10.1, we see that cycle inventory is proportional to the lot size. \\nA supply chain in which stages produce or purchase in larger lots has more cycle inven\\xad\\ntory than a supply chain in which stages purchase in smaller lots. For example, if a com\\xad\\npeting department store with the same demand purchases in lot sizes of 200 pairs of \\njeans, it will carry a cycle inventory of only 100 pairs of jeans. \\nLot sizes and cycle inventory also influence the flow time of material within the \\nsupply chain. Recall from Little's law (Equation 3.1) that \\naverage inventory \\nAverage flow time = --------'~ \\naverage flow rate \\nFor any supply chain, average flow rate equals demand. We thus have \\ncycle inventory Q \\nAverage flow time resulting from cycle inventory = . d emand 2D \\nFor lot sizes of 1,000 pairs of jeans and daily demand of 100 pairs of jeans, we obtain \\n. . .

The larger the cycle inventory, the longer \\nis the lag time between when a product is produced and when it is sold. A lower level \\nof cycle inventory is always desirable, because long time lags leave a firm vulnerable to \\ndemand changes in the marketplace. A lower cycle inventory also decreases a firm's \\nworking capital requirement. Toyota, for example, keeps a cycle inventory of only a few \\nhours of production between the factory and most suppliers. As a result, Toyota is \\nnever left with unneeded parts and its working capital requirements are less than those \\nof its competitors. Toyota also allocates very little space in the factory to inventory. \\nBefore we suggest actions that a manager can take to reduce cycle inventory, it is \\nimportant to understand why stages of a supply chain produce or purchase in large lots \\nand how lot size reduction affects supply chain performance. \\nCycle inventory is held to take advantage of economies of scale and reduce cost \\nwithin a supply chain. To understand how the supply chain achieves these economies of \\nscale, we first identify supply chain costs that are influenced by lot size. \\nThe average price paid per unit purchased is a key cost in the lot sizing decision. A \\nbuyer may increase the lot size if this action results in a reduction in the price paid per \\nunit purchased. For example, if the jeans manufacturer charges $20 per pair for orders \\nunder 500 pairs of jeans and $18 per pair for larger orders, the store manager at Jean\\xad\\nMart gets the lower price by ordering in lots of at least 500 pairs of jeans. The price paid \\nper unit is referred to as the material cost and is denoted by C. It is measured in $/unit. \\nIn many practical situations, material cost displays economies of scale and increasing \\nlot size decreases material cost. \\nThe fixed ordering cost includes all costs that do not vary with the size of the order \\nbut are incurred each time an order is placed. For example, there may be a fixed \\nadministrative cost to place an order, a trucking cost to transport the order, and a labor \\ncost to receive the order. Jean-Mart, for example, incurs a cost of $400 for the truck \\nregardless of the number of pairs of jeans shipped. If the truck can hold up to 2,000 \\npairs of jeans, a lot size of 100 pairs results in a transportation cost of $4/pair, whereas \\na lot size of 1,000 pairs results in a transportation cost of $0.40/pair. Given the fixed \\ntransportation cost per batch, the store manager can reduce transportation cost per \\nunit by increasing the lot size. The fixed ordering cost per lot or batch is denoted by S \\n(commonly thought \\nof as a setup cost) and is measured in $/lot. The ordering cost also \\ndisplays economies of scale, and increasing the lot size decreases the fixed ordering \\ncost per unit purchased. \\nHolding cost is the cost of carrying one unit in inventory for a specified period of \\ntime, usually one year. It is a combination of the cost of capital, the cost of physically \\nstoring the inventory, and the cost that results from the product becoming obsolete. \\nThe holding cost is denoted by H and is measured in $/unit/year. It may also be \\nobtained as a fraction, h, of the unit cost of the product. Given a unit cost of C, the \\nholding cost H is given by \\nH = hC (10.2) \\nThe total holding cost increases with an increase in lot size and cycle inventory. \\nTo summarize, the costs that must be considered in any lot sizing decision are \\n• Average price per unit purchased, $C/unit \\n• Fixed ordering cost incurred per lot, $S/lot \\n• Holding cost incurred per unit per year, $H/unit/year = hC \\nLater in the chapter, we discuss how the various costs may be estimated in practice. \\nHowever, for the purposes of this discussion, we assume they are already known.\"),\n",

If a manager considers the holding cost alone, he or she will reduce the lot \\nsize and cycle inventory. Economies of scale in purchasing and ordering, however, \\nmotivate a manager to increase the lot size and cycle inventory. A manager must make \\nthe trade-off that minimizes total cost when making lot sizing decisions. \\nIdeally, cycle inventory decisions should be made considering the total cost across the \\nentire supply chain. In practice, however, it is generally the case that each stage makes its \\ncycle inventory decisions independently. As we discuss later in the chapter, this practice \\nincreases the level of cycle inventory as well as the total cost in the supply chain. \\nAny stage of the supply chain exploits economies of scale in its replenishment \\ndecisions in the following three typical situations: \\n1. A fixed cost is incurred each time an order is placed or produced. \\n2. The supplier offers price discounts based on the quantity purchased per lot. \\n3. The supplier offers short-term price discounts or holds trade promotions. \\nIn the next three sections, we review how purchasing managers can take advantage \\nof these situations. \\n10.2 ECONOMIES OF SCALE TO EXPLOIT FIXED COSTS \\nTo better understand the trade-offs discussed in this section, consider a situation that \\noften arises in daily life-the purchase of groceries and other household products. \\nThese may be purchased at a nearby convenience store or at a Sam\\'s Club (a large \\nwarehouse club selling consumer goods), which is generally located much farther away. \\nThe fixed cost of going shopping is the time it takes to go to either location. This fixed \\ncost is much lower for the nearby convenience store. Prices, however, are higher at the \\nlocal convenience store. Taking the fixed cost into account, we tend to tailor our lot \\nsize ~ecision accordingly. When we need only a small quantity, we go to the nearby con\\xad\\nvenience store because the benefit of a low fixed cost outweighs the cost of the conve\\xad\\nnience store\\'s higher prices. When we are buying a large quantity, however, we go to \\nSam\\'s Club, where the lower prices over the larger quantity purchased more than make \\nup for tlie increase in fixed cost. \\nIn this section we focus on the situation in which a fixed cost associated with plac\\xad\\ning, receiving, and transporting an order is incurred each time the order is placed. A \\npurchasing manager wants to minimize the total cost of satisfying demand and must \\ntherefore make the appropriate cost trade-offs when making the lot sizing decision. We \\nstart by considering the lot sizing decision for a single product. \\nLOT SIZING FOR A SINGLE PRODUCT \\n(ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY) \\nAs Best Buy sells its current inventory of HP computers, the purchasing manager \\nplaces a replenishment order for a new lot of Q computers.

Using a lot size of 1,100 \\n(instead of 980) increases annual costs to $98,636 (from $97,980). Even though the order \\nsize is more than 10 percent larger than the optimal order size Q*, total cost increases by \\nonly 0.6 percent. This issue can be relevant in practice. For example, Best Buy may find \\nthat the economic order quantity for computer diskettes is 6.5 cases. The manufacturer \\nmay be reluctant to ship half a case and may want to charge extra for this service. Our \\ndiscussion illustrates that Best Buy is perhaps better off with lot sizes of six or seven \\ncases, because this change has a very small impact on their inventory-related costs but \\ncan save on any fee that the manufacturer charges for shipping half a case. \\nIf demand at Best Buy increases to 4,000 computers a month (demand has \\nincreased by a factor of 4), the EOQ formula shows that the optimal lot size doubles \\nand the number of orders placed per year also doubles. In contrast, average flow time \\ndecreases by a factor of 2. In other words, as demand increases, cycle inventory mea\\xad\\nsured in terms of days (or months) of demand should reduce if the lot sizing decision is \\nmade optimally. This observation can be stated as follows: \\nLet us return to the situation where monthly demand for the Deskpro model is 1,000 \\ncomputers. Now assume that the manager would like to reduce the lot size to Q = 200 units \\nto reduce flow time. If this lot size is decreased without any other change, we have \\nAnnual inventory-related costs = ( ~ )s + (~)he = $250,000 \\nThis is-significantly higher than the total cost of $97,980 that Best Buy incurred \\nwhen ordering in lots of 980 units as in Example 10-1. Thus, there are clear financial rea\\xad\\nsons why the store manager would be unwilling to reduce the lot size to 200. To make it \\nfeasible to reduce the lot size, the manager should work to reduce the fixed order cost. \\nFor example, if the fixed cost associated with each lot is reduced to $1,000 (from the cur\\xad\\nrent value of $4,000), the optimal lot size reduces to 490 (from the current value of 980). \\nWe illustrate the relationship between desired lot size and order cost in Example 10-2. \\nExample 10-2: Relationship Between Desired Lot Size and Order Cost \\nThe store manager at Best Buy would like to reduce the optimal lot size from 980 to 200. \\nFor this lot size reduction to be optimal, the store manager wants to evaluate how much \\nthe order cost per lot should be reduced. \\nAnalysis: In this case we have \\nDesired lot size, Q* = 200 \\nAnnual demand, D = 1 ,000 x 12 = 12,000 units \\nUnit cost per computer, C = $500 \\nHolding cost per year as a fraction of inventory value, h = 0.2'),\n",

As pointed out earlier, one major source of fixed costs is transportation. In \\nseveral companies the array of products sold is divided into families or groups, with \\neach group managed independently by a separate product manager. This results in sep\\xad\\narate orders and deliveries for each product family, thus increasing the overall cycle \\ninventory. Aggregating orders and deliveries across product families is an effective \\nmechanism to lower cycle inventories. \\nConsider the data from Example 10-1. Assume that the demand for each of the \\nfour models is 1,000 units per month. In this case, if each product manager orders sep\\xad\\narately, she would order a lot size of 980 units. Across the four models, the total cycle \\ninventory would thus be 1960 units. \\nNow consider the case where the store manager at Best Buy realizes that all four \\nshipments originate from the same source. She asks the product managers to coordi\\xad\\nnate their purchasing to ensure that all four products arrive on the same truck. In this \\ncase the optimal combined lot size across all four models turns out to be 1,960 units. \\nThis is equivalent to 490 units for each model. As a result of aggregating orders and \\nspreading the fixed transportation cost across multiple products originating from the \\nsame supplier, it becomes financially optimal for the store manager at Best Buy to \\nreduce the lot size for each individual product. This action significantly reduces the \\ncycle inventory as well as cost to Best Buy. \\nAnother way to achieve this result is to have a single delivery coming from multi\\xad\\nple suppliers (allowing fixed transportation cost to be spread across multiple suppliers) \\nor have a single truck delivering to multiple retailers (allowing fixed transportation \\ncost to be spread across multiple retailers). This observation can be stated as follows: \\nWal-Mart and other retailers have facilitated aggregation across multiple supply \\nand delivery points without storing intermediate inventories through the use of cross\\xad\\ndocking. Each supplier sends full truckloads to the distribution center (DC), containing \\nan aggregate delivery destined for multiple retail stores. At the DC, each inbound truck \\nis unloaded, product is cross-dockt?d, and outbound trucks are loaded. Each outbound \\ntruck now contains product aggregated from several suppliers for one retail store.'),\n",

As \\nmore products are included in a single order, the product variety on a truck increases. \\nThe receiving warehouse now has to update inventory records for more items per \\ntruck. In addition, the task of putting inventory into storage now becomes more expen\\xad\\nsive because each distinct item must be stocked in a separate location. Thus, when \\nattempting to reduce lot sizes, it is important to focus on reducing these costs. \\nAdvanced shipping notices (ASN) are files sent electronically by the supplier to the \\ncustomer that contain precise records of the contents of the truck. These electronic \\nnotices facilitate updating of inventory records as well as the decision regarding stor\\xad\\nage locations, helping to reduce the fixed cost of receiving. RFID technology is also \\nlikely to help reduce the variety related fixed costs associated with receiving. The \\nreduced fixed cost of receiving makes it optimal to reduce the lot size ordered, thus \\nreducing cycle inventory. We next analyze how optimal lot sizes may be determined in \\nsuch a setting. \\nLOT SIZING WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCTS OR CUSTOMERS \\nIn general, the ordering, transportation, and receiving cost of an order grows with the \\nvariety of products or pickup points. For example, it is cheaper for Wal-Mart to receive \\na truck containing a single product than it is to receive a truck containing many differ\\xad\\nent products, because the inventory update and restocking effort is much less for a sin\\xad\\ngle product. A portion of the fixed cost of an order can be related to transportation \\n(this depends only on the load and is independent of product variety on the truck). A \\nportion of the fixed cost is related to loading and receiving (this cost increases with \\nvariety on the truck). We now discuss how optimal lot sizes may be determined in such \\na setting. \\nOur objective is to arrive at lot sizes and an ordering policy that minimize the total \\ncost. We assume the following inputs: \\nDi: Annual demand for product i \\nS: Order cost incurred each time an order is placed, independent of the \\nvariety of products included in the order \\nsi: Additional order cost incurred if product i is included in the order \\nIn the case of Best Buy and multiple models, the store manager may consider three \\napproaches to the lotsizing decision: \\n1. Each product manager orders his model independently. \\n2. The product managers jointly order every product in each lot. \\n3. Product managers order jointly but not every order contains every product; that is, \\neach lot contains a selected subset of the products. \\nThe first approach does not use any aggregation and results in high cost. The sec\\xad\\nond approach aggregates all products in each order. The weakness of the second \\napproach is that low-demand products are aggregated with high-demand products in \\nevery order. This complete aggregation results in high costs if the product-specific \\norder cost for the low-demand products is large. In such a situation it may be better to \\norder the low-demand products less frequently than the high-demand products. This \\npractice results in a reduction of the product-specific order cost associated with the \\nlow-demand product. As a result, the third approach is likely to yield the lowest cost. \\nHowever, it is more compl~x to coordinate. · \\nWe consider the example of Best Buy purchasing computers and illustrate the \\neffect of each of the three approaches on supply chain costs. \\n----· ··-----~~---~~~---~-~---~------~------~--\\n---'),\n",

Each model costs Best Buy $500. \\nA fixed transportation cost of $4,000 is incurred each time an order is delivered. For each \\nmodel ordered and delivered on the same truck, an additional fixed cost of $1 ,000 is \\nincurred for receiving and storage. Best Buy incurs a holding cost of 20 percent. Evaluate \\nthe lot sizes that the Best Buy manager should order if lots for each product are ordered \\nand delivered independently. Also evaluate the annual cost of such a policy. \\nAnalysis: In this example we have the following information: \\nDemand, OL = 12,000/year, OM = 1 ,200/year, OH = 120/year \\nCommon order cost, S = $4,000 \\nProduct-specific order cost, St = $1 ,000, sM = $1,000, sH = $1,000 \\nHolding cost, h = 0.2 \\nUnit cost, CL = $500, CM = $500, CH = $500 \\nBecause each model is ordered and delivered independently, a separate truck delivers \\neach model. Thus, a fixed ordering cost of $5,000 ($4,000 + $1 ,000) is incurred for each \\nproduct delivery. The optimal ordering policies and resulting costs for the three products \\n(when the three products are ordered independently) are evaluated using the EOQ formula \\n(Equation 1 0.5) and are shown in Table 10-1. \\nThe Litepro model is ordered 11 times a year, the Medpro model is ordered 3.5 times \\na year, and the Heavypro model is ordered 1 .1 times each year.

Next we consider a pol\\xad\\nicy underwhich the product managers do not necessarily order all models each time an \\norder is placed but still coordinate their orders. \\nLots are Ordered and Delivered .Jointly for a Selected Subset \\nof the Products \\nWe now discuss a procedure that is more selective in combining products to be ordered \\njointly. The procedure we discuss here does not necessarily provide the optimal solu\\xad\\ntion. It does, however, yield an ordering policy whose cost is close to optimal. \\nThe first step is to identify the product that is to be ordered most frequently. For \\neach successive product we then identify orders in which it is included. In general, it is \\nnot optimal for a particular product to be included at regular intervals (i.e., it should be \\nincluded in every second or third order). In our procedure, however, we make the \\nassumption that each product is included in the order at regular intervals. Once we \\nhave identified the most frequently ordered model, for each successive product i we \\nidentify the frequency mi> where model i is ordered every mi deliveries. \\nWe first describe the procedure in general and then apply it to the specific exam\\xad\\nple. Assume that the products are indexed by i, where i varies from 1 ton (assuming a \\ntotal of n products). Each product i has an annual demand Di, a unit cost Ci, and a \\nproduct-specific order cost si. The common order cost isS. \\nStep 1: As a first step, identify the most frequently ordered product assuming each \\nproduct is ordered independently. In this case a fixed cost of S + si is allocated to each \\nproduct. For each product i (using Equation 10.6), evaluate the ordering frequency: \\n--I hCpi \\nni - \\\\j 2( S + si) \\nThis is the frequency at which product i would be ordered if it were the only product \\nbeing ordered (in which case a fixed cost of S + si would be incurred per order). Let n be \\nthe frequency of the most frequently ordered product; that is, n is the maximum among \\nall ni. The most frequently ordered product is included each time an order is placed. \\nStep 2: Identify the frequency with which other products are included with the most \\nfrequently ordered product; that is, calculate the order frequency for each product as a \\nmultiple of the order frequency of the most frequently ordered product. The most fre\\xad\\nquently ordered product is ordered each time and all of the fixed cost S is thus allo\\xad\\ncated to it. For each of the other products i, we thus have only the product-specific \\nfixed cost component si. The order frequency for all other products is thus calculated \\nusing only the product-specific fixed cost in Equation 10.6. For each product i (other \\nthan the most frequently ordered product), evaluate the ordering frequency: \\n= ~hCD· n· = __ z_z \\nl 2si \\nEvaluate the frequency of product i relative to the most frequently ordered prod\\xad\\nuct to be mi, where \\nmi = nfni \\nIn general, mi will contain a fractional component.

We must answer the following two basic questions in this context: \\n1. Given a pricing schedule with quantity discounts, what is the optimal purchasing \\ndecision for a buyer seeking to maximize profits? How does this decision affect the \\nsupply chain in terms of lot sizes, cycle inventories, and flow times? \\n2. Under what conditions should a supplier offer quantity discounts? What are \\nappropriate pricing schedules that a supplier, seeking to maximize profits, should \\noffer? \\nWe start by studying the optimal response of a retailer (the buyer) when faced \\nwith either of the two lot size-based discount schemes offered by a manufacturer (the \\nsupplier). The retailer\\'s objective is to select lot sizes to minimize the total annual \\nmaterial, order, and holding cost. Next we evaluate the optimal lot size in the case of all \\nunit quantity discounts. \\nALL UNIT QUANTITY DISCOUNTS \\nIn all unit quantity discounts, the pricing schedule contains specified break points q0, \\nqh ... , q, where q0 = 0. If an order placed is at least as large as qi but smaller than qi+1, \\neach unit is obtained at a cost of Ci. In general, the unit cost decreases as the quantity \\nordered increases; that is, Co ::::::: C1 ::::::: · · · ::::::: C,. The retailer\\'s objective is to decide on \\nlot sizes to maximize profits or, equivalently, to minimize the sum of material, order, \\nand holding costs. \\nFor all unit discounts, the average unit cost varies with the quantity ordered, as \\nshown in Figure 10-3. Observe that under this discount scheme, ordering q1 + 1 units \\nmay be less expensive (in terms of material cost) than ordering q1 - 1 units. \\nThe solution procedure evaluates the optimal lot size for each price C 1 (this forces \\na lot size between q1 and qi+1) and then settles on the lot size that minimizes the over\\xad\\nall cost.

This discussion demon\\xad\\nstrates that there can be significant order sizes and thus cycle inventory in the absence \\nof any formal fixed ordering costs as long as quantity discounts are offered. Thus, quan\\xad\\ntity discounts lead to a significant buildup of cycle inventory in a supply chain. In many \\nsupply chains, quantity discounts contribute more to cycle inventory than fixed order\\xad\\ning costs. This forces us once again to question the value of quantity discounts in a sup\\xad\\nply chain. \\nWHY QUANTITY DISCOUNTS? \\nIn this section we develop arguments supporting the presence of quantity discounts in \\na supply chain. Quantity discounts are valuable in a supply chain for the following two \\nreasons: \\n1. Improved coordination to increase total supply chain profits \\n2. Extraction of surplus through price discrimination \\nCoordination to Increase Total Supply Chain Profits \\nA supply chain is coordinated if the decisions the retailer and supplier make maximize \\ntotal supply chain profits. In reality, each stage in a supply chain may have a separate \\nowner and thus attempt to maximize that stage's own profits. The result of this inde\\xad\\npendent decision making can be a lack of coordination in a supply chain because \\nactions that maximize retailer profits may not maximize supply chain profits. In this \\nsection we discuss how a manufacturer may use appropriate quantity discounts to \\nensure that total supply chain profits are maximized even if the retailer is acting to \\nmaximize its own profits. \\nQuantity d_iscounts for commodity products. Economists have argued that \\nfor commodity products such as milk, a competitive market exists and costs are driven \\ndown to the products' marginal cost. In this case, the market sets the price and the \\nfirm's objective is to lower costs. Consider, for example, the online retailer DO, dis\\xad\\ncussed earlier. It can be argued that it sells a commodity product. When placing orders \\nwith the manufacturer, DO makes its lot sizing decisions based on costs it faces. \\nDemand for vitamins is 10,000 bottles per month. DO incurs a fixed order place\\xad\\nment, transportation, and receiving cost of $100 each time it places an order for vita\\xad\\nmins with the manufacturer. DO incurs a holding cost of 20 percent. The manufacturer \\ncharges $3 for each bottle of vitamins purchased. Using the EOQ formula (Equation \\n10.5), DO evaluates its optimal lot size to be Q = 6,324 bottles. As a result, the annual \\nordering and holding costs incurred by DO are $3,795. \\nEach time DO places an order, the manufacturer has to process, pack, and ship \\nthe order. The manufacturer has a line packing bottles at a steady rate that matches \\ndemand. The manufacturer incurs a fixed order filling cost of $250, production cost of \\n$2 per bottle, and a holding cost of 20 percent. Given that DO orders in lot sizes\"),\n",

The total cost, across the supply chain, as a result of DO ordering in lots of \\n6,324 is thus $6,009 + $3,795 = $9,804. \\nIf DO can be convinced to order in lots of 9,165 units, the total cost in the supply \\nchain decreases to $9,165. There is thus an opportunity for the supply chain to save \\n$638. Observe that ordering in lots of 9,165 bottles raises the cost for DO by $238 per \\nyear to $4,059 (even though it reduces overall supply chain costs). The manufacturer's \\ncosts, in contrast, go down by $902 to $5,106 per year. The manufacturer must offer DO \\na suitable incentive for DO to raise its lot size. \\nA lot size-based quantity discount is an appropriate incentive in this case. If the \\nmanufacturer were to price vitamins so that each bottle cost $3 for all orders with lot \\nsizes under 9,165 and $2.9978 for all orders in lots of 9,165 or more, DO has an incen\\xad\\ntive to order in lots of 9,165 bottles. The quantity discount reduces the material cost for \\nDO by just enough to offset the increase in ordering and holding cost. The manufac\\xad\\nturer returns $264 to DO as material cost reduction (in the form of a quantity discount) \\nto make it optimal for DO to order in lots of 9,165 bottles. The manufacturer's and the \\ntotal supply chain's profits increase by $638 in this case. In practice, the manufacturer \\nmay have to share some of the $638 increase with DO. The precise division of the \\nincrease in supply chain profits depends on the relative bargaining power of different \\nstages in the supply chain. \\nObserve that offering a lot size-based discount in this case decreases total supply \\nchain cost. It does, however, increase the lot size the retailer purchases and thus \\nincreases cycle inventory in the supply chain. \\n· Our discussion on coordination for commodity products highlights the important \\nlink between the lot size-based quantity discount offered and the order costs incurred by \\nthe manufacturer. As the manufacturer works on lowering order or setup cost, the dis\\xad\\ncount it offers to retailers should change. For a low enough setup or order cost, the man\\xad\\nufacturer gains very little from using a lot size-based quantity discount. In the example \\nof DO discussed earlier, if the manufacturer lowers its fixed cost per order from $250 to \\n$100, the total supply chain costs are close to the minimum without quantity discounts \\neven if DO is trying to minimize its cost. Thus, if its fixed order costs are lowered to \\n$100, it makes sense for the manufacturer to eliminate all quantity discounts. In most \\ncompanies, however, marketing and sales design quantity discounts while operations \\nworks on reducing setup or order cost. As a result, changes in pricing do not always \\noccur in response to setup cost reduction in manufacturing. It is very important that \\nthe two functions coordinate these activities.\"),\n",

Few competitors have a similar product, so it can be argued that the \\nprice at which DO sells vitaherb influences demand. Assume that the annual demand \\nfaced by DO is given by the demand curve 360,000 - 60,000p, where p is the price at \\nwhich DO sells vitaherb. The manufacturer incurs a production cost of Cs = $2 per \\nbottle of vitaherb sold. The manufacturer must decide on the price to charge DO, and \\nDO in turn must decide on the price to charge the customer. When the two make their \\ndecisions independently, it is optimal for DO to charge a price ofp = $5 per bottle and \\nfor the manufacturer to charge DO a price of CR = $4 per bottle. The total market \\ndemand in this case is for 360,000 - 60,000p = 60,000 bottles of vitaherb. The profit at \\nDO as a result of this policy is given by \\nProfR = p(360,000- 60,000p) - (360,000- 60,000p)CR = $60,000 \\nThe profit at the manufacturer is given by \\nProfM = CR(180,000 - 30,000CR) - Cs(180,000 - 30,000CR) = $120,000 \\nIf the two stages coordinate pricing and DO prices at p = $4, market demand is \\n120,000 bottles. The total supply chain profit if the two stages coordinate is \\n120,000 X ($4 - $2) = $240,000. As a result of each stage settings its price indepen\\xad\\ndently, the supply chain thus loses $60,000 in profit. This phenomenon is referred to as \\ndouble marginalization. Double marginalization leads to a loss in profit because the \\nsupply chain margin is divided between two stages but each stage makes its decision \\nconsidering only its local margin. \\nThere are two pricing schemes that the manufacturer may use to achieve the coor\\xad\\ndinated solution and maximize supply chain profits even though DO acts in a way that \\nmaximizes its own profit. \\n1. Two-part tariff: In this case the manufacturer charges its entire profit as an up-front \\nfranchise fee-and then sells to the retailer at cost. It is then optimal for the retailer to \\nprice as though the two stages are coordinated. In the case of DO, recall that total supply \\nchain profit when the two stages coordinate is $240,000 with DO charging the customer \\n$4 per bottle of vitaherb. The profit made by DO when the two stages do not coordinate \\nis $60,000. One option available to the manufacturer is to construct a two-part tariff by \\nwhich DO is charged an up-front fee of $180,000 and material cost of CR = $2 per bottle. \\nDO maximizes its profit if it prices the vitamins at p = $4 per bottle. It has annual sales of \\n360,000 - 60,000p = 120,000 and profits of $60,000. The manufacturer makes a profit of \\n$180,000 given its material cost of $2 per bottle. \\n2. Volume-based quantity discount: Observe that the two-part tariff is really a \\nvolume-based quantity discount. The average material cost for DO declines as it increases \\nthe quantity it purchases per year. This observation can be made explicit by designing a \\nvolume-based discount scheme that also achieves coordination.

The manufacturer must offer DO a volume discount to \\nencourage DO to purchase this quantity. The manufacturer thus offers a price of CR = $4 \\nper bottle if the quantity DO purchases per year is less than 120,000. If the total volume in \\nthe year is 120,000 or higher, DO has to pay only CR = $3.50.It is then optimal for DO to \\norder 120,000 units and price them at p = $4 per bottle to the customers. The total profit \\nearned by DO is (360,000 - 60,000 X p) X (p - CR) = $60,000. The total profit \\nearned by the manufacturer is 120,000 X ( CR - $2) = $180,000. The total supply chain \\nprofit is $240,000. \\nAt this stage, we have seen that even in the absence of inventory-related costs, \\nquantity discounts play a role in supply chain coordination and improved supply chain \\nprofits. The discount schemes that are optimal, however, are volume based and not lot \\nsize based. In our analysis, we do not assume any inventory-related costs, so one may \\nargue that in the presence of inventory costs, lot size-based discounts may be optimal. \\nIt can be shown, however, that even in the presence of inventory costs (order and hold\\xad\\ning), a two-part tariff or volume-based discount, with the manufacturer passing on \\nsome of the fixed cost to the retailer, optimally coordinates the supply chain and max\\xad\\nimizes profits given the assumption that customer demand decreases when the retailer \\nincreases price. \\nA key distinction between lot size-based and volume discounts is that lot size dis\\xad\\ncounts are based on the quantity purchased per lot, not the rate of purchase. Volume \\ndiscounts, in contrast, are based on the rate of purchase or volume purchased on aver\\xad\\nage per specified time period (say, a month, quarter, or year). Lot size-based discounts \\ntend to raise the cycle inventory in the supply chain by encouraging retailers to \\nincrease the size of each lot. Volume-based discounts, in contrast, are compatible with \\nsmall lots that reduce cycle inventory. Lot size-based discounts make sense only when \\nthe manufacturer incurs very high fixed cost per order. In all other instances it is better \\nto have volume-based discounts. \\nOne can make the point that even with volume-based discounts, retailers will tend \\nto increase the size of the lot toward the end of the evaluation period. For example, \\nthe manufacturer offers DO a 2 percent discount if the number of bottles of vitaherb \\npurchased over a quarter exceeds 40,000. This policy will not affect the lot sizes DO \\norders early during the quarter and DO will order in small lots to match the quantity \\nordered With demand. Consider a situation, however, in which DO has sold only \\n30,000 bottles with a week left before the end of the quarter. To get the quantity dis\\xad\\ncount, DO may order 10,000 bottles over the last week even though it expects to sell \\nonly 3,000.

The situation in which orders peak \\ntoward the end of a financial horizon is referred to as the hockey stick phenomenon \\nbecause demand increases dramatically toward the end of a period, similar to the way \\na hockey stick bends upward toward the end of the stick. It has been observed in \\nmany industries. One possible solution to this phenomenon is to base the volume dis\\xad\\ncounts on a rolling horizon. For example, each week the manufacturer may offer DO \\nthe volume discount based on sales over the last 12 weeks. Such a rolling horizon \\ndampens the hockey stick phenomenon by making each week the last week in some \\n12-week horizon. \\nThus far, we have only discussed the scenario in which the supply chain has a sin\\xad\\ngle retailer. One may ask whether our insights are robust and also apply if the supply \\nchain has multiple retailers, each with different demand curves, all supplied by a single \\nmanufacturer. As one would expect, the form of the discount scheme to be offered \\nbecomes more complicated in these settings (typically, instead of having only one \\nbreak point at which the volume-based discount is offered, there are multiple break\\xad\\npoints). The basic form of the optimal pricing scheme, however, does not change. The \\noptimal discount continues to be volume based, with the average price charged to the \\nretailers decreasing as the rate of purchase (volume purchased per unit time) \\nincreases. \\nPrice Discrimination to Maximize Supplier Profits \\nPrice discrimination is the practice whereby a firm charges differential prices to maxi\\xad\\nmize profits. An example of price discrimination is airlines: Passengers traveling on the \\nsame plane often pay different prices for their seats. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 15, setting a fixed price for all units does not maximize \\nprofits for the manufacturer. In principle, the manufacturer can obtain the entire area \\nunder the demand curve above its marginal cost by pricing each unit differently based \\non customers' marginal evaluation at each quantity. Quantity discounts are one mech\\xad\\nanism for price discrimination because customers pay different prices based on the \\nquantity purchased. \\nNext we discuss trade promotions and their impact on lot sizes and cycle inventory \\nin the supply chain. \\n10.4 SHORT-TERM DISCOUNTING: TRADE PROMOTIONS \\nManufacturers use trade promotions to offer a discounted price and a time period over \\nwhich the discount is effective. For example, a manufacturer of canned soup may offer \\na price discount of 10 percent for the shipping period December 15 to January 25. For \\nall purchases within the specified time horizon, retailers get a 10 percent discount.

A few of the key goals (from the manufacturer's \\nperspective) of a trade promotion are as follows1: \\n1. Induce retailers to use price discounts, displays, or advertising to spur sales. \\n2. Shift inventory from the manufacturer to the retailer and the customer. \\n3. Defend a brand against competition. \\nAlthough these may be the manufacturer's objectives, it is not clear that they are \\nalways achieved as the result of a trade promotion. Our goal in this section is to inves\\xad\\ntigate the impact of a trade promotion on the behavior of the retailer and the perfor\\xad\\nmance of the entire supply chain. The key to understanding this impact is to focus on \\nhow a retailer reacts to a trade promotion that a manufacturer offers. In response to a \\ntrade promotion, the retailer has the following options: \\n1. Pass through some or all of the promotion to customers to spur sales. \\n2. Pass through very little of the promotion to customers but purchase in greater \\nquantity during the promotion period to exploit the temporary reduction in price. \\nThe first action lowers the price of the product for the end customer, leading to \\nincreased purchases and thus increased sales for the entire supply chain. The second \\naction does not increase purchases by the customer but increases the amount of inven\\xad\\ntory held at the retailer. As a result, the cycle inventory and flow time within the supply \\nchain increase. \\nA forward buy occurs when a retailer purchases in the promotional period for \\nsales in future periods. A forward buy helps reduce the retailer's future cost of goods \\nfor product sold after the promotion ends. Although a forward buy is often the \\nretailer's appropriate response to a price promotion, it usually increases demand vari\\xad\\nability with a resulting increase in inventory and flow times within the supply chain, \\nand it can decrease supply chain profits. \\nOur objective in this section is to understand a retailer's optimal response when \\nfaced with a trade promotion. We identify the factors affecting the forward buy and \\nquantify the size of a forward buy by the retailer. We also identify factors that influence \\nthe amount of the promotion that a retailer passes on to the customer. \\nWe first illustrate the impact of a trade promotion on forward buying behavior of \\nthe retailer. Consider a Cub Foods supermarket selling chicken noodle soup manufac\\xad\\ntured by the Campbell Soup Company. Customer demand for chicken noodle soup is \\nD cans per year. The price Campbell charges is $C per can. Cub Foods incurs a holding \\ncost of h (per dollar of inventory held for a year). Using the EOQ formula (Equation \\n10.5), Cub Foods normally orders in the following lot sizes: \\nQ* = (2l5S \\\\jF;C \\nCampbell announces that it is offering a discount of $d per can for the corning four\\xad\\nweek period. Cub Foods must decide how much to order at the discounted price com\\xad\\npared to the lot size of Q* that it normally orders. Let Qd be the lot size ordered at the \\ndiscounted price. \\nThe costs the retailer must consider when making this decision are material cost, \\nholding cost, and order cost. Increasing the lot size Qd lowers the material cost for Cub \\nFoods because they purchase more cans (for sale now and in the future) at the dis\\xad\\ncounted price.

Cub Food's goal \\nis to make the trade-off that minimizes the total cost. \\nThe inventory pattern when a lot size of Qd is followed by lot sizes of Q* is shown in \\nFigure 10-5. The objective is to identify Qd that minimizes the total cost (material cost + \\nordering cost + holding cost) over the time interval during which the quantity Qd \\n(ordered during the promotion period) is consumed. \\nThe precise analysis in this case is complex, so we present a result that holds under \\nsome restrictions.2 The first key assumption is that the discount is offered once, with no \\nfuture discounts. The second key assumption is that the retailer takes no action (such as \\npassing on part of the trade promotion) to influence customer demand. The customer \\ndemand thus remains unchanged. The third key assumption is that we analyze a period \\nover which the demand is an integer multiple of Q*. With these assumptions, the opti\\xad\\nmal order quantity at the discounted price is given by \\nQd = dD + CQ* \\n(C- d)h C- d \\n(10.15) \\nIn practice, retailers are often aware of the timing of the next promotion.

In \\nthe absence of the trade promotion we have the following: \\nCycle inventory at DO = Q*/2 = 6,324/2 = 3,162 bottles \\nAverage flow time= Q*/2R = 6,324/(2R) = 0.3162 months \\nThe optimal lot size during the promotion is obtained using Equation 1 0.15 and is given by \\nQ\\nd __ dR + CQ* __ 0.15 X 120,000 3 X 6,324 \\n--------'---+ = 38,236 \\n(C-d)h C- d (3.00-0.15) X 0.20 3.00-0.15 \\nDuring the promotion, DO should place an order for a lot size of 38,236. In other words, DO \\nplaces an order for 3.8236 months' worth of demand. In the presence of the trade promo\\xad\\ntion we have \\nCycle inventory at DO = Qd 12 = 38,236/2 = 19,118 bottles \\nAverage flow time = Q*/2R = 38,236/(2R) = 1.9118 months \\nIn this case, the forward buy is given by \\nForward buy = d - Q* = 38,236 - 6,324 = 31 ,912 bottles \\nAs a result of this forward buy, DO will not place any order for the next 3.8236 months \\n(without a forward buy, DO would have placed 31 ,912/6,324 = 5.05 orders for 6,324 bot\\xad\\ntles each during this period). Observe that a 5 percent discount causes the lot size to \\nincrease by more than 500 percent. \\nAs the example illustrates, forward buying as a result of trade promotions leads to \\na significant increase in the quantity ordered by the retailer. The large order is then \\nfollowed by a period of low orders to compensate for the inventory built up at the \\nretailer. The fluctuation in orders as a result of trade promotions is one of the major \\ncontributors to the bullwhip effect discussed in Chapter 17. The retailer can justify the \\nforward buying during a trade promotion because it decreases its total cost. In \\ncontrast, the manufacturer can justify this action only if it has either inadvertently built \\nup a lot of excess inventory or the forward buy allows the manufacturer to smooth \\ndemand by shifting it from peak- to low-demand periods. In practice, manufacturers \\noften build up inventory in anticipation of planned promotions. During the trade \\npromotion this inventory shifts to the retailer, primarily as a forward buy. If the for\\xad\\nward buy during trade promotions is a significant fraction of total sales, manufacturers \\nend up reducing the revenues they earn from sales because most of the product is sold \\nat a discount. The increase in inventory and the decrease in revenues often lead to \\na redqction in manufacturer as well as total supply chain profits as a result of trade \\npromotions.3 \\nNow let us consider the extent to which the retailer may find it optimal to pass \\nthrough some of the discount to the end customer to spur sales. As Example 10-10 \\nshows, it is not optimal for the retailer to pass through the entire discount to the cus\\xad\\ntomer. In other words, it is optimal for the retailer to capture part of the promotion and \\npass through only part of it to the customer. \\n3See Blattberg and Neslin (1990) for more details.\"),\n",

The normal price charged by the manufacturer to the retailer is CR = $3 per bottle. \\nIgnoring all inventory-related costs, evaluate the optimal response of DO to a discount of \\n$0.15 per unit. \\nAnalysis: The profits for DO, the retailer, are given as follows: \\nProfR = (300,000-60,000p)p- (300,000-60,000p)CR \\nThe retailer prices to maximize profits and the optimal retail price is obtained by setting the \\nfirst derivative of retailer profits with respect top to 0. This implies that \\n300,000 - 120,000p + 60,000CR = 0 \\nor \\np = (300,000 + 60,000CR)/120,000 (10.16) \\nSubstituting CR = $3 into Equation 1 0.16, we obtain a retail price of p = $4. As a result the \\ncustomer demand at the retailer in the absence of the promotion is \\nDR = 300,000 - 60,000p = 60,000 \\nDuring the promotion the manufacturer offers a discount of $0.15, resulting in a price to the \\nretailerofCR = $2.85. Substituting into Equation 10.16, the optimal price set by DO is \\np = (300,000 + 60,000 X 2.85)/120,000 = $3.925 \\nObserve that the retailer's optimal response is to pass through only $0.075 of the $0.15 \\ndiscount to the customer. The retailer does not pass through the entire discount. At the \\ndiscounted price, DO experiences a demand of \\nDR = 300,000 - 60,000p = 64,500 \\nThis represents an increase of 7.5 percent in demand. In this case it is optimal for DO to \\npass on half the trade promotion discount to the customers. This action results in a 7.5 \\npercent increase in customer demand. \\nFrom Examples 10-9 and 10-10, observe that the increase in customer demand \\nresulting from a trade promotion (7.5 percent of demand in Example 10-10) is insignif\\xad\\nicant relative to the increased purchase by the retailer due to forward buying (500 percent \\nfrom Example 10-9). The impact of the increase in customer demand may be further \\ndampened by customer behavior. For many products, such as detergent and tooth\\xad\\npaste, most of the increase in customer purchases is a forward buy by the customer; \\ncustomers are unlikely to start brushing their teeth more frequently simply because \\nthey have purchased a lot of toothpaste. For such products, a trade promotion does not \\ntruly increas~ demand. \\nManufacturers have always struggled with the fact that retailers pass along only a \\nsmall fraction of a trade discount to the customer. Almost a quarter of all distributor \\ninventories in the dry-grocery supply chain in 1990 could be attributed to forward \\nbuying.4 \\n4 See Kurt Salmon Associates (1993).\"),\n",

This realization has \\nled many firms, including the world\\'s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, and several manufac\\xad\\nturers such as Proctor & Gamble, to adopt \"Every Day Low Pricing\" (EDLP). Here \\nthe price is fixed over time and no short-term discounts are offered. This eliminates any \\nincentive for forward buying. As a result, all stages of the supply chain purchase in \\nquantities that match demand. \\nIn general, the discount passed through by the retailer to the consumer is influ\\xad\\nenced by the retailer deal elasticity, which is the increase in retail sales per unit dis\\xad\\ncount in price. The higher the deal elasticity, the more of the discount the retailer is \\nlikely to pass through to the consumer. Thus, trade promotions by the manufacturer \\nmay make sense for products with a high deal elasticity that ensures high pass-through \\nby the retailer, and high holding costs that ensure low forward buying. Blattberg and \\nNeslin (1990) identify paper goods as products with high deal elasticity and holding \\ncost. They also identify trade promotions as being more effective with strong brands \\nrelative to weak brands. \\nTrade promotions may also make sense as a competitive response. In a category such \\nas cola, some customers are loyal to their brand while others switch depending on the \\nbrand being offered at the lowest price. Consider a situation in which one of the com\\xad\\npetitors, say Pepsi, offers retailers a trade promotion. Retailers increase their purchases \\nof Pepsi and pass through some of the discount to the customer. Price-sensitive cus\\xad\\ntomers increase their purchase of Pepsi. If a competitor such as Coca-Cola does not \\nrespond, it loses some market share in the form of price-sensitive customers. A case \\ncan be made that a trade promotion is justified in such a setting as a competitive \\nresponse. Observe that with both competitors offering trade promotions, there is no \\nreal increase in demand for either unless customer consumption grows. Inventory in \\nthe supply chain, however, does increase for both brands. This is then a situation in \\nwhich trade promotions are a competitive necessity but they increase supply chain \\ninventory, leading to reduced profits for all competitors. \\nTrade promotions should be designed so that retailers limit their forward buying \\nand pass along more of the discount to end customers. The manufacturer\\'s objective is \\nto increase market share and sales without allowing the retailer to forward buy signifi\\xad\\ncant amounts. This outcome can be achieved by offering discounts to the retailer that \\nare based on actual sales to customers rather than the amount purchased by the \\nretailer. The discount price thus applies to items sold to customers (sell-through) dur\\xad\\ning the promotion, not the quantity purchased by the retailer (sell-in ). This eliminates \\nall incentive for forward buying. \\nGiven the information technology in place, many manufacturers today offer scanner\\xad\\nbased promotions by which the retailer receives credit for the promotion discount for \\nevery unit sold. Another option is to limit the allocation to a retailer based on past sales. \\nThis is also an effort to limit the amount that the retailer can forward buy. It is unlikely, \\nhowever, that retailers will accept such schemes for weak brands. \\n10.5 MANAGING MULT1ECHELON CYCLE INVENTORY \\nA multiechelon supply chain has multiple stages and possibly many players at each \\nstage.

Assume that production is instantaneous, so the manufacturer can produce a \\nlot when needed. If the two stages are not synchronized, the manufacturer may pro\\xad\\nduce a new lot of size Q right after shipping a lot of size Q to the retailer. Inventory at \\nthe two stages is as shown in Figure 10-6. In this case the retailer carries an average \\ninventory of Q/2 and the manufacturer carries an average inventory of about Q. \\nOverall supply chain inventory can be lowered if the manufacturer synchronizes \\nits production to be ready just in time to be shipped to the retailer. In ,this case, the \\nmanufacturer carries no inventory and the retailer carries an average inventory of Q/2. \\nIn this case, synchronization of production and replenishment allows the supply chain \\nto lower total cycle inventory from about 3Q/2 to Q/2. \\nFor a simple multiechelon supply chain with only one player at each stage, order\\xad\\ning policies in which the lot size at each stage is an integer multiple of the lot size at its \\nimmediate customer have been shown to be quite close to optimal.

Given the robustness of cycle inventory models, it is better \\nto get a good approximation quickly rather than spend a lot of time trying to estimate \\ncosts exactly. \\nOur goal is to identify incremental costs that change with the lot sizing decision. \\nWe can ignore costs that are unchanged with a change in lot size. For example, if a fac\\xad\\ntory is running at 50 percent of capacity and all labor is full-time and not earning over\\xad\\ntime, it can be argued that the incremental setup cost for labor is zero. Reducing the lot \\nsize in this case will not have any impact on setup cost until either labor is fully utilized \\n(and earning overtime) or machines are fully utilized (with a resulting loss in produc\\xad\\ntion capacity). \\nINVENTORY HOLDING COST \\nHolding cost is estimated as a percentage of the cost of a product and is the sum of the \\nfollowing major components. \\n• Cost of capital: This is the dominant component of holding cost for products that do \\nnot become obsolete quickly. The appropriate approach is to evaluate the weighted\\xad\\naverage cost of capital (WACC), 5 which takes into account the required return on \\nthe firm's equity and the cost of its debt. These are weighted by the amount of equity \\nand debt financing that the firm has. The fonnula for the WACC is \\nE D \\nWACC = D + E (Rt + J3 X MRP) + D + ERb(l - t) \\nwhere \\nE = amount of equity \\nD =amount of debt \\nRt =risk-free rate of return (which is usually in the mid-single digits) \\n13 = the firm's beta \\nMRP = market risk premium (which is around the high single digits) \\nRb = rate at which the firm can borrow money (related to its debt rating) \\nt =tax rate \\nThe WACC is adjusted for use in a pretax setting as follows: \\nPretax WACC =after-tax WACC/(1 - t) \\nThe pretax WACC is appropriate for a firm that can increase its business using \\nfunds released by reducing inventories because inventory calculations are done \\npretax. Most of these numbers can be found in a company's annual report and in \\nany equity research report on the company. The borrowing rate comes from \\ntables listing the rates charged for bonds from firms with the same credit ratings. \\nThe risk-free rate is the return on U.S. Treasuries, and the market risk premium is \\nthe return of the market above the risk-free rate. If access to a company's finan\\xad\\ncial structure is not available, a good approximation can be made by using num\\xad\\nbers from public companies in the same industry and of similar size. \\n5See Brealey and Myers (2000). \\n·-·······-··-···-----····-···---··----~-~---··-· \\n\\\\~ -'---~\"),\n",

Perishable products have high obso\\xad\\nlescence rates. Even nonperishables can have high obsolescence rates if they have \\nshort life cycles. A product with a life cycle of six months has an effective obsoles\\xad\\ncence cost of 200 percent. At the other end of the spectrum are products such as \\ncrude oil that take a long time to become obsolete or spoil. For such products a \\nvery low obsolescence rate may be applied. \\n• Handling cost: Handling cost should include only incremental receiving and stor\\xad\\nage costs that vary with the quantity of product received. Quantity-independent \\nhandling costs that vary with the number of orders should be included in the \\norder cost. The quantity-dependent handling cost often does not change if quan\\xad\\ntity varies within a range. If the quantity is within this range (e.g., the range of \\ninventory a crew of four people can unload per period of time), incremental han\\xad\\ndling cost added to the holding cost is zero. If the quantity handled requires more \\npeople, an incremental handling cost is added to the holding cost. \\n• Occupancy cost: The occupancy cost reflects the incremental change in space cost \\ndue to changing cycle inventory. If the firm is being charged based on the actual \\nnumber of units held in storage, we have the direct occupancy cost. Firms often \\nlease or purchase a fixed amount of space. As long as a marginal change in cycle \\ninventory does not change the space requirements, the incremental occupancy \\ncost is zero. Occupancy costs often take the form of a step function, with a sudden \\nincrease in cost when capacity is fully utilized and new space must be acquired. \\n• Miscellaneous costs: The final component of holding cost deals with a number of \\nother relatively small costs. These costs include theft, security, damage, tax, and \\nadditional insurance charges that are incurred. Once again, it is important to esti\\xad\\nmate the incremental change in these costs on changing cycle inventory. \\nORDER COST \\nThe order cost includes all incremental costs associated with placing or receiving an \\nextra order that are incurred regardless of the size of the order. Components of order \\ncost include: \\n• Buyer time: Buyer time is the incremental time of the buyer placing the extra \\norder. This cost should be included only if the buyer is utilized fully. The incre\\xad\\nmental cost of getting an idle buyer to place an order is zero and does not add to \\nthe order cost. Electronic ordering can significantly reduce the buyer time to \\nplace an order. \\n• Transportation costs: A fixed transportation cost is often incurred regardless of the \\nsize of the order. For instance, if a truck is sent to deliver every order, it costs the \\nsame amount to send a half-empty truck as it does a full truck. Less-than-truckload \\npricing also includes a fixed component that is independent of the quantity \\nshipped and a variable component that increases with the quantity shipped. The \\nfixed component should be included in the order cost. \\n• Receiving costs: Some receiving costs are incurred regardless of the size of the \\norder. These include any administration work such as purchase order matching \\nand any effort associated with updating inventory records. Receiving costs that \\nare quantity dependent should not be included here. \\n• Other costs: Each situation can have costs unique to it that should be considered \\nif they are incurred for each order regardless of the quantity of that order.'),\n",

It is important \\nthat the order cost include only the incremental change in real cost for an additional \\norder. The order cost is often a step function that is zero when the resource is not fully \\nutilized, but takes on a large value when the resource is fully utilized. At that point the \\norder cost is the cost of the additional resource required. \\n,-\\n10.7 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Balance the appropriate costs to choose the optimal amount of cycle inventory in a supply \\nchain. \\nCycle inventory generally equals half the lot size. Therefore, as the lot size grows, so \\ndoes the cycle inventory. In deciding on the optimal amount of cycle inventory, the supply \\nchain goal is to minimize the total cost-the order cost, holding cost, and material cost. As \\ncycle inventory increases, so does the holding cost. However, the order cost and, in some \\ninstances, the material cost decrease with an increase in lot size and cycle inventory. The \\nEOQ balances the three costs to obtain the optimal lot size. The higher the order and trans\\xad\\nportation cost, the higher the lot size and cycle inventory. \\n2. Understand the impact of quantity discounts on lot size and cycle inventory. \\nLot size-based quantity discounts increase the lot size and cycle inventory within the \\nsupply chain because they encourage buyers to purchase in larger quantities to take advan\\xad\\ntage of the decrease in price. \\n3. Devise appropriate discounting schemes for a supply chain. \\nQuantity discounts are justified to increase total supply chain profits. Volume-based \\ndiscounts are more effective than lot size-based discounts in increasing supply chain profits \\nwithout increasing lot size and cycle inventory. \\n4. Understand the impact of trade promotions on lot size and cycle inventory. \\nTrade promotions increase inventory and total supply chain costs through forward buy\\xad\\ning, which shifts future demand to the present and creates a spike in demand followed by a \\ndip. The increased variability raises inventories and costs. \\n5. Identify managerial levers that reduce lot size and cycle inventory in a supply chain without \\nincreasing cost. \\nThe key managerial levers for reducing lot size and thus cycle inventory in the supply chain \\nwithout increasing cost are the following: \\n• Reduce fixed ordering and transportation costs incurred per order. \\n• Implement volume-based discounting schemes rather than individual lot size-based dis\\xad\\ncounting schemes. \\n• Eliminate or reduce trade promotions and encourage EDLP. Base trade promotions on \\nsell-through rather than sell-into the retailer. \\nDiscussion Questions \\n1. Consider a supermarket deciding on the size of its replenishment order from Proctor & \\nGamble. What costs should it take into account when making this decision? \\n2. Discuss how various costs for the supermarket change as it decreases the lot size ordered \\nfrom Proctor & Gamble. \\n3. As demand at the supermarket chain grows, how would you expect the cycle inventory mea\\xad\\nsured in days of inventory to change? Explain. \\n4. The manager at the supermarket wants to decrease the lot size without increasing the costs \\nhe incurs. What actions can he take to achieve this objective? \\n----------'),\n",

Why is it appropriate to include only the incremental cost when estimating the holding and \\norder cost for a firm? \\n1. Harley Davidson has its engine assembly plant in Milwaukee and its motorcycle assembly \\nplant in Pennsylvania. Engines are transported between the two plants using trucks, with each \\ntrip costing $1,000. The motorcycle plant assembles and sells 300 motorcycles each day. Each \\nengine costs $500, and Harley incurs a holding cost of 20 percent per year. How many engines \\nshould Harley load onto each truck? What is the cycle inventory of engines at Harley? \\n2. As part of its initiative to implement just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing at the motorcycle \\nassembly plant, Harley has reduced the number of engines loaded on each truck to 100. If \\neach truck trip still costs $1,000, how does this decision impact annual inventory costs at \\nHarley? What should the cost of each truck be if a load of 100 engines is to be optimal for \\nHarley? \\n3. Harley purchases components from three suppliers. Components purchased from Supplier \\nA are priced at $5 each and used at the rate of 20,000 units per month. Components pur\\xad\\nchased from Supplier B are priced at $4 each and are used at the rate of 2,500 units per \\nmonth. Components purchased from Supplier Care priced at $5 each and used at the rate of \\n900 units per month. Currently Harley purchases a separate truckload from each supplier. \\nAs part of its JIT drive, Harley has decided to aggregate purchases from the three suppliers. \\nThe trucking company charges a fixed cost of $400 for the truck with an additional charge of \\n$100 for each stop. Thus, if Harley asks for a pickup from only one supplier, the trucking \\ncompany charges $500; from two suppliers it charges $600; and from three suppliers it \\ncharges $700. Suggest a replenishment strategy for Harley that minimizes annual cost. \\nCompare the cost of your strategy with Harley's current strategy of ordering separately \\nfrom each supplier. What is the cycle inventory of each component at Harley? \\n4. Prefab, a furniture manufacturer, uses 20,000 square feet of plywood per month.

Describe different measures of product availability. \\n4. Utilize managerial levers available to lower safety inventory and improve product availability. \\nI\\nn this chapter, we discuss how safety inventory can help a supply chain improve \\nproduct availability in the presence of supply and demand variability. We discuss \\nvarious measures of product availability and how managers can set safety inventory \\nlevels to provide the desired product availability. We also explore what managers can \\ndo to reduce the amount of safety inventory required while maintaining or even \\nimproving product availability. \\n11.1 THE ROLE OF SAFETY INVENTORY IN A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nSafety inventory is inventory carried to satisfy demand that exceeds the amount fore\\xad\\ncasted for a given period. Safety inventory is carried because demand is uncertain and \\na prociuct shortage may result if actual demand exceeds the forecast demand. \\nConsider, for example, Bloomingdale's, a high-end department store. Bloomingdale's \\nsells purses purchased from Gucci, an Italian manufacturer. Given the high transporta\\xad\\ntion cost from Italy, the store manager at Bloomingdale's orders in lots of 600 purses. \\nDemand for purses at Bloomingdale's averages 100 a week. Gucci takes three weeks to \\ndeliver the purses to Bloomingdale's in response to an order. If there is no demand \\nuncertainty and exactly 100 purses are sold each week, the store manager at \\nBloomingdale's can place an order when the store has exactly 300 purses remaining. In \\nthe absence of demand uncertainty, such a policy ensures that the new lot arrives just \\nas the last purse is being sold at the store. \\nHowever, given demand fluctuations and forecast errors, actual demand over the \\nthree weeks may be higher or lower than the 300 purses forecasted. If the actual \\ndemand at Bloomingdale's is higher than 300, some customers will be unable to pur\\xad\\nchase purses, resulting in a potential loss of margin for Bloomingdale's. The store man\\xad\\nager thus decides to place an order with Gucci when the store still has 400 purses. This \\npolicy improves product availability for the customer because the store now runs out\"),\n",

Given an average weekly \\ndemand of 100 purses, the store will have an average of 100 purses remaining when the \\nreplenishment lot arrives. Safety inventory is the average inventory remaining when the \\nreplenishment lot arrives. Thus, Bloomingdale\\'s carries a safety inventory of 100 purses. \\nGiven a lot size of Q = 600 purses, the cycle inventory, the focus of the previous \\nchapter, is Q/2 = 300 purses. The inventory profile at Bloomingdale\\'s in the presence \\nof safety inventory is shown in Figure 11-1. As Figure 11-1 illustrates, the average \\ninventory at Bloomingdale\\'s is the sum of the cycle and safety inventories. \\nThis example illustrates a trade-off that a supply chain manager must consider \\nwhen planning safety inventory. On one hand, raising the level of safety inventory \\nincreases product availability and thus the margin captured from customer purchases. \\nOn the other hand, raising the level of safety inventory increases inventory holding \\ncosts. This issue is particularly significant in industries in which product life cycles are \\nshort and demand is very volatile. Carrying excessive inventory can help counter \\ndemand volatility but can really hurt if new products come on the market and demand \\nfor the product in inventory dries up. The inventory on hand then becomes worthless. \\nIn today\\'s business environment, it has become easier for customers to search \\nacross stores for product availability. When shopping for books online, if Amazon.com \\nis out of a title, a customer can easily check to see if BarnesandNoble.com has the title \\navailable. The increased ease of searching puts pressure on firms to improve product \\navailability. Simultaneously, product variety has grown with increased customization. \\nAs a result, markets have become increasingly heterogeneous and demand for individ\\xad\\nual products is very unstable and difficult to forecast. Both the increased variety and \\nthe greater pressure for availability push firms to raise the level of safety inventory \\nthey hold. Given the product variety and high demand uncertainty in most high-tech \\nsupply chains, a significant fraction of the inventory carried is safety inventory. \\nAs product variety has grown, however, product life cycles have shrunk. Thus, it is \\nmore likely that a product that is \"hot\" today will be obsolete tomorrow, which \\nincreases the cost to firms of carrying too much inventory. Thus, a key to the success of \\nany supply chain is to figure out ways to decrease the level of safety inventory carried \\nwithout hurting the level of product availability. \\nThe importance of reduced safety inventories is emphasized by the experience of \\nDell and Compaq in the early part of 1998, when prices dropped. Compaq carried 100 \\ndays of inventory compared to Dell, which carried only 10 days of inventory. Declining \\nprices hurt Compaq much more, given the extra inventory that it carried. In fact, this \\nsituation resulted in Compaq not making any profits in the first quarter of 1998. \\nA key to Dell\\'s success has been its ability to provide a high level of product avail\\xad\\nability to customers while carrying very low levels of safety inventory in its supply'),\n",

This fact has also played a very important role in the success of Wal-Mart and \\nSeven-Eleven Japan. \\nFor any supply chain, there are two key questions to consider when planning safety \\ninventory: \\n1. What is the appropriate level of safety inventory to carry? \\n2. What actions can be taken to improve product availability while reducing safety \\ninventory? \\nThe remainder of this chapter focuses on answering these questions. Next we con\\xad\\nsider factors that influence the appropriate level of safety inventory. \\n11.2 DETERMINING APPROPRIATE LEVEL \\nOF SAFETY INVENTORY \\nThe appropriate level of safety inventory is determined by the following two factors: \\n• The uncertainty of both demand and supply \\n• The desired level of product availability \\nAs the uncertainty of supply or demand grows, the required level of safety inven\\xad\\ntories increases. Consider the sale of Palm personal digital assistants (PDAs) at B&M \\nOffice Supplies. When a new Palm model is introduced, demand is highly uncertain. \\nB&M thus carries a much higher level of safety inventory relative to demand. As the \\nmarket's reaction to the new model becomes clearer, uncertainty is reduced and \\ndemand is easier to predict. At that point, B&M can carry a lower level of safety inven\\xad\\ntory relative to demand. \\nAs the desired level of product availability increases, the required level of safety \\ninventory also increases. If B&M targets a higher level of product availability for the \\nnew Palm model, it must carry a higher level of safety inventory for that model. \\nNext we discuss some measures of demand uncertainty. \\nMEASURING DEMAND UNCERTAINTY \\nAs discussed in Chapter 7, demand has a systematic as well as a random component. \\nThe goal of forecasting is to predict the systematic component and estimate the ran\\xad\\ndom component. The random component is usually estimated as the standard devia\\xad\\ntion of forecast error. We assume the following inputs for demand: \\nD: Average demand per period \\naD: Standard deviation of demand (forecast error) per period \\nFor now, we assume that weekly demand for the Palm at B&M is normally distributed, \\nwith a mean of D and a standard deviation of aD. \\nLead time is the gap between when an order is placed and when it is received. In \\nour discussion, we denote the lead time by L. In the B&M example, L is the time \\nbetween when B&M orders Palms and when they are delivered. In this case, B&M is \\nexposed to the uncertainty of demand during the lead time. Whether B&M is able to \\nsatisfy all demand from inventory depends on the demand for Palms experienced dur\\xad\\ning the lead time and the inventory B&M has when a replenishment order is placed. \\nThus, B&M must estimate the uncertainty of demand during the lead time, not just a \\nsingle period. We now evaluate the distribution of demand over k periods, given the \\ndistribution of demand during each period.\"),\n",

Given demand with a mean of ).L and \\na standard deviation of a, we have \\ncv = a 1 ).L \\nThe coefficient of variation measures the size of the uncertainty relative to \\ndemand. It captures the fact that a product with mean demand of 100 and a standard \\ndeviation of 100 has greater demand uncertainty than a product with mean demand of \\n1,000 and a standard deviation of 100. Considering the standard deviation alone cannot \\ncapture this difference. \\nNext we discuss some measures of product availability. \\nMEASURING PRODUCT AVAILABILITY \\nProduct availability reflects a firm's ability to fill a customer order out of available \\ninventory. A stockout results if a customer order arrives when product is not available. \\nThere are several ways to measure product availability. Some of the important mea\\xad\\nsures are as listed next. \\n1. Product fill rate (jr) is the fraction of product demand that is satisfied from prod\\xad\\nuct in inventory. Fill rate should be measured over specified amounts of demand rather \\nthan time. Uius, it is more appropriate to measure fill rate over every million units of \\ndemand rather than every month. Fill rate is equivalent to the probability that product \\ndemand is supplied from available inventory. Assume that B&M provides Palms to 90 \\npercent of its customers from inventory, with the remaining 10 percent lost to a neigh\\xad\\nboring competitor because of a lack of available inventory. In this case B&M achieves \\na fill rate of 90 percent. \\n2. Order fill rate is the fraction of orders that are filled from available inventory. Order \\nfill rate should also be measured over a specified number of orders rather than time. In a \\nmultiproduct scenario, an order is filled from inventory only if all products in the order \\ncan be supplied from the available inventory. In the case of B&M, a customer may order \\na Palm along with a calculator. The order is filled from inventory only if both the Palm \\nand the calculator are available through the store. Order fill rates tend to be lower than \\nproduct fill rates because all products must be in stock for an order to be filled. \\n3. Cycle service level (CSL) is the fraction of replenishment cycles that end with all the \\ncustomer demand being met. A replenishment cycle is the interval between two\"),\n",

The CSL is equal to the probability of not having a \\nstockout in a replenishment cycle. CSL should be measured over a specified number of \\nreplenishment cycles. If B&M orders replenishment lots of 600 Palms, the interval \\nbetween the arrival of two successive replenishment lots is a replenishment cycle. If the \\nmanager at B&M manages inventory such that the store does not run out of inventory \\nin 6 out of 10 replenishment cycles, the store achieves a CSL of 60 percent. Observe \\nthat a CSL of 60 percent typically results in a much higher fill rate. In the 60 percent of \\ncycles in which B&M does not run out of inventory, all customer demand is satisfied \\nfrom available inventory. In the 40 percent of cycles in which a stockout does occur, \\nmost of the customer demand is satisfied from inventory. Only the small fraction \\ntoward the end of the cycle that arrives after B&M is out of inventory is lost. As a \\nresult, the fill rate is much higher than 60 percent. \\nThe distinction between product fill rate and order fill rate is usually not signifi\\xad\\ncant in a single-product situation. When a firm is selling multiple products, however, \\nthis difference may be significant. For example, if most orders include 10 or more dif\\xad\\nferent products that are to be shipped, an out-of-stock situation of one product results \\nin the order not being filled from stock. The firm in this case may have a poor order fill \\nrate even though it has good product fill rates. Tracking order fill rates is important \\nwhen customers place a high value on the entire order being filled simultaneously. \\nNext we describe two replenishment policies that are often used in practice. \\nREPLENISHMENT POLICIES \\nA replenishment policy consists of decisions regarding when to reorder and how much \\nto reorder. These decisions determine the cycle and safety inventories along with the fr \\nand the CSL. Replenishment policies may take any of several forms. We restrict atten\\xad\\ntion to two types: \\n1. Continuous review: Inventory is continuously tracked and an order for a lot size Q is \\nplaced when the inventory declines to the reorder point (ROP). As an example, con\\xad\\nsider the store manager at B&M who continuously tracks the inventory of Palms. He \\norders 600 Palms when the inventory drops below 400. In this case, the size of the order \\ndoes not change from one order to the next. The time between orders may fluctuate \\ngiven variable demand. \\n2. Periodic review: Inventory status is checked at regular periodic intervals and an \\norder is placed to raise the inventory level to a specified threshold. As an example, con\\xad\\nsider the purchase of film at B&M. The store manager does not track film inventory \\ncontinuously. Every Saturday, employees check film inventory and the manager orders \\nenough so that the available inventory and the size of the order total equals 1,000 films. \\nIn this case the time between orders is fixed.

Given the lead time of L weeks and a mean \\nweekly demand of D, using Equation 11.2, we have \\nExpected demand during lead time = D L \\nGiven that the store manager places a replenishment order when ROP Palms are on \\nhand, we have \\nSafetyinventory,ss = ROP- DL (11.3) \\nThis is because, on average, D L Palms will sell over the period between when the order \\nis placed and when the lot arrives. The average inventory when the replenishment lot \\narrives will thus be ROP- DL. \\nExample 11-1: Evaluating safety inventory given an inventory policy \\nAssume that weekly demand for Palms at B&M Computer World is normally distributed, with \\na mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500. The manufacturer takes two weeks to fill an \\norder placed by the B&M manager. The store manager currently orders 10,000 Palms when \\nthe inventory on hand drops to 6,000. Evaluate the safety inventory carried by B&M and the \\naverage inventory carried by B&M. Also evaluate the average time spent by a Palm at B&M. \\nAnalysis: Under this replenishment policy, we have \\nAverage demand per week, D = 2,500 \\nStandard deviation of weekly demand, O\"o = 500 \\nAverage lead time for replenishment, L = 2 weeks \\nReorder point, ROP = 6,000 \\nAverage lot size, Q = 10,000 \\nUsing Equation 11.3, we thus have \\nSafetyinventory,ss = ROP- DL = 6,000- 5,000 = 1,000 \\nB&M thus carries a safety inventory of 1 ,000 Palms. From Chapter 10, recall that \\nCycle inventory = 0/2 = 10,000/2 = 5,000 \\nWe thus have \\nAverage inventory = cycle inventory + safety inventory = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \\nB&M thus carries an average of 6,000 Palms in inventory. Using Little\\'s law (Equation 3.1), \\nwe have \\nAverage flow time = average inventory /throughput == 6,000/2,500 = 2.4 weeks \\nEach Palm thus spends an average of 2.4 weeks at B&M. \\nNext we discuss how to evaluate the CSL given a replenishment policy. \\nEvaluating Cycle Service Level Given a Replenishment Policy \\nGiven a replenishment policy, our goal is to evaluate CSL, the probability of not stock\\xad\\ning out in a replenishment cycle.

The \\nlead time is L weeks and weekly demand is normally distributed, with a mean of D and \\na standard deviation of crD.

From Equation 11.2, we know that demand during lead time is normally \\ndistributed, with a mean of D L and a standard deviation of aL. Using the notation for \\nthe normal distribution from Appendix 11A, the CSL is \\nCSL = F(ROP, D L• aL) (11.4) \\nWe now illustrate this evaluation in Example 11-2. \\nExarnple 11-2: Evaluating cycle service level given a replenishment policy \\nWeekly demand for Palms at B&M is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a stan\\xad\\ndard deviation of 500.

Thus, whether a stockout occurs or \\nnot depends on the demand during the lead time of two weeks. \\nBecause demand across time is independent, we use Equation 11.2 to obtain demand \\nduring the lead time to be normally distributed with a mean of DL and a standard deviation \\nof uL, where · \\nDL = DL = 2 X 2,500 = 5,000 uL = VLuo = V2 X 500 = 707 \\nUsing Equation 11.4, the CSL is evaluated as \\nCSL = probability of not stocking out in a cycle = F(ROP, DL, uL) = F(6,000, 5,000, 707) \\nUsing Equation 11.19 in Appendix 11 B, the CSL is evaluated using the Excel function \\nNORMDISTas \\nCSL = F(ROP, DL, uL) = NORMOIST(ROP, DL, uL, 1) \\n= NORMDIST(6,000, 5,000, 707, 1) = 0.92 \\nA CSL of 0.92 implies that in 92 percent of the replenishment cycles, B&M supplies all \\ndemand from available inventory. In the remaining 8 percent of the cycles, stockouts occur \\nand some demand is not satisfied because of the lack of inventory. \\nNext we discuss the evaluation of the fill rate given a replenishment policy. \\nEvaluating Fill Rate Given a Replenishment Policy \\nRecall that fill rate measures the proportion of customer demand that is satisfied from \\navailable inventory. Fill rate is generally a more relevant measure than cycle service level \\nbecause it allows the retailer to estimate the fraction of demand that is turned into sales. \\nThe two measures are very closely related, as raising the cycle service level also raises the \\nfill rate for a firm. Our discussion focuses on evaluating fill rate for a continuous review \\npolicy under which Q units are ordered when the quantity on hand drops to the ROP. \\nTo evaluate the fill rate it is important to understand the process by which a stock\\xad\\nout occurs during a replenishment cycle. A stockout occurs if the demand during the \\nlead time exceeds the ROP. We thus need to evaluate the average amount of demand \\nin excess of the ROP in each replenishment cycle. \\nThe expected shortage per replenishment cycle (ESC) is the average units of \\ndemand that are not satisfied from inventory in stock per replenishment cycle. Given a \\nlot size of Q (which is also the average demand in a replenishment cycle), the fraction \\nof demand lost is thus ESCjQ. The product fill rate fr is thus given by \\nfr = 1-ESC/Q = (Q- ESC)/Q (11.5)'),\n",

Using Equation 11.5, we thus obtain the following fill rate: \\nfr = (Q - ESC)/Q = (1 0,000 - 25)/1 0,000 = 0.9975 \\nIn other words, 99.75 percent of the demand is filled from inventory in stock.

We now discuss the impact that each fac\\xadtor has on the safety inventory. \\nAs the desired product availability goes up, the required safety inventory also increases because the supply chain must now be able to accommodate uncommonly high demand or uncommonly low supply. For the Wal-Mart situation in Example 11-5, we eval\\xaduate the required safety inventory for varying levels of fill rate as shown in Table 11-1. Observe that raising the fill rate from 97.5 percent to 98.0 percent requires an addi\\xadtional116 units of safety inventory, whereas raising the fill rate from 99.0 percent to 99.5 percent requires an additional268 units of safety inventory. Thus, the marginal increase in safety inventory grows as product availability rises. This phenomenon highlights the importance of selecting suitable product availability levels. It is very important for a supply chain manager to be aware of the products that require a high level of availabil\\xadity and hold high safety inventories only for those products. It is not appropriate to select a very high level of product availability and require it arbitrarily for all products. \\nFrom Equation 11.9, we see that the required safety inventory ss is also influenced by the standard deviation of demand during the lead time, aL· The standard deviation of demand during the lead time is influenced by the duration of the lead time L as well as the standard deviation of periodic demand aD, as shown in Equation 11.2. The rela\\xadtionship between safety inventory and aD is linear in that a 10 percent increase in aD results in a 10 percent increase in safety inventory. Safety inventory also increases with an increase in lead time L. The safety inventory, however, is proportional to the square root of the lead time (if demand is independent over time) and thus grows more slowly than the lead time itself.'),\n",

The aforementioned \\ndiscussion highlights two key managerial levers that may be used to achieve this goal. \\n1. Reduce the supplier lead time L: If lead time decreases by a factor of k, the required \\nsafety inventory decreases by a factor of Vk. The only caveat here is that reducing \\nthe supplier lead time requires significant effort from the supplier, whereas reduction \\nin safety inventory occurs at the retailer. Thus it is important for the retailer to share \\nsome of the resulting benefits as discussed in Chapter 14. Wal-Mart, Seven-Eleven \\nJapan, and many other retailers apply tremendous pressure on their suppliers to \\nreduce the replenishment lead time. Manufacturers such as Dell also require suppliers \\nto reduce their lead times. In each case, the benefit has manifested itself in the form of \\nreduced safety inventory. \\n2. Reduce the underlying uncertainty of demand (represented by uv): If aD is reduced \\nby a factor of k, the required safety inventory also decreases by a factor of k. A reduction \\nin aD may be achieved by better market intelligence and the use of more sophisticated \\nforecasting methods. Seven-Eleven Japan provides its store managers with detailed \\ndata about prior demand along with weather and other factors that may influence \\ndemand. This market intelligence allows the store managers to make better forecasts, \\nreducing uncertainty. In most supply chains, however, the key to reducing the underly\\xad\\ning forecast uncertainty is to link all forecasts throughout the supply chain to customer \\ndemand data. A lot of the demand uncertainty exists only because each stage of the \\nsupply chain plans and forecasts independently. This distorts demand throughout the \\nsupply chain, increasing uncertainty. Improved coordination, as discussed in Chapter \\n17, can often reduce the demand uncertainty significantly. Both Dell and Seven-Eleven \\nJapan share demand information with their suppliers, reducing uncertainty and thus \\nsafety inventory within the supply chain. \\n11.3 IMPACT OF SUPPLY UNCERTAINTY \\nON SAFETY INVENTORY \\nIn our discussion to this point, we have focused on situations with demand uncertainty \\nin the form of a forecast error. In many practical situations, supply uncertainty also \\nplays -a significant role. Consider the case of the Dell assembly plant in Austin, Texas. \\nDell assembles computers to customer order. When it is planning its level of compo\\xad\\nnent inventory, Dell clearly has to take demand uncertainty into account. Suppliers, \\nhowever, may not be able to deliver the components required on time, for a variety of \\nreasons. Dell must also account for this supply uncertainty when planning its safety \\ninventories. \\nIn our previous discussion we considered the replenishment lead time to be fixed. \\nIn this section we consider the case in which the lead time is uncertain and identify the \\nimpact of lead time uncertainty on safety inventories. Assume that the customer \\ndemand per period for Dell computers and the replenishment lead time from the com\\xad\\nponent supplier are normally distributed. We are provided the following inputs: \\nD: Average demand per period \\naD: Standard deviation of demand per period \\nL: Average lead time for replenishment \\nsL: Standard deviation of lead time'),\n",

Dell experiences a stockout of compo\\xadnents if demand during the lead time exceeds the ROP; that is, the quantity on hand when Dell places a replenishment order. Thus we need to identify the distribution of customer demand during the lead time. Given that both lead time and periodic \\ndemand are uncertain, demand during the lead time is normally distributed with a mean of D L and a standard deviation cr L• where \\nDL = DL crL = VLcrb + D 2st (11.11) \\nGiven the distribution of demand during the lead time in Equation 11.11 and a desired CSL, Dell can obtain the required safety inventory using Equation 11.9. If product availability is specified as a fill rate, Dell can obtain the required safety inven\\xad\\ntory using the procedure outlined in Example 11-5. In Example 11-6, we illustrate the impact of lead time uncertainty on the required level of safety inventory at Dell. \\nExample 11-6: Impact of lead time uncertainty on safety inventory \\nDaily demand for PCs at Dell is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500. A key component in PC assembly is the hard drive. The hard drive supplier takes an average of L = 7 days to replenish inventory at Dell. Dell is targeting a CSL of 90 percent (providing a fill rate close \\nto 1 00 percent) for its hard drive inventory. Evaluate the safety inventory of hard drives that Dell must carry if the standard deviation of the lead time is seven days. Dell is working with the supplier to reduce the standard deviation to zero. Evaluate the reduction in safety inventory that Dell can expect as a result of this initiative. \\nAnalysis: In this case we have \\nAverage demand per period, D = 2,500 \\nStandard deviation of demand per period, fJ\"O = 500 \\nAverage lead time for replenishment, L = 7 days \\nStandard deviation of lead time, sL = 7 days \\nWe first evaluate the distribution of demand during the lead time. Using Equation 11.11, we have \\nMean demand during lead time, DL = DL = 2,500 x 7 = 17,500 \\nStandard deviation of demand during lead time fJ\"L = V LfJ\"b + D 2s[ \\n~----~----~~~ \\n= V7 X 5002 + 2,5002 X 72 = 17,550 \\nThe required safety inventory is obtained using Equations 11.9 and 11.24 as follows: \\nss = F$ 1 (CSL) X (J\"L = NORMSINV(CSL) X fJ\"L = NORMSINV(0.90) X 17,550 \\n= 22,491 hard drives \\nIf the standard deviation of lead time is seven days, Dell must carry a safety inventory of 22,491 drives. Observe that this is equivalent to about nine days of demand for hard drives. \\nIn Table 11-2 we provide the required safety inventory as Dell works with the supplier to reduce standard deviation of lead time down to zero. From Table 11-2, observe that the reduction in lead time uncertainty allows Dell to reduce its safety inventory of hard drives by a significant amount. As the standard deviation of lead time declines from seven days to zero, the amount of safety inventory declines from about nine days of demand to less than a day of demand. \\nThe preceding example emphasizes the impact of lead time variability on safety \\ninventory requirements (and thus material flow time) and the large potential bene\\xad\\nfits from reducing lead time variability or improving on -time deliveries. Often, \\nsafety inventory calculations in practice do not include a\\'ny measure of supply uncertainty, resulting in levels that may be lower than required. This hurts product \\navailability.'),\n",

One is to have local inventories in each region and the other is to aggregate all inventories into one centralized facility. Our goal is to compare safety inventories in the two cases. With a replenishment lead time of L and a desired cycle service level CSL, the total safety inventory in the decen\\xadtralized case is (using Equation 11.9). \\nk \\nTotal safety inventory in decentralized option 2:.Fs1(CSL) X vL X ai (11.ll) \\ni=l \\nIf all inventories are aggregated in a central location, we need to evaluate the distribution of aggregated demand.

PiPt-aj \\ni=l i>j (11.13) \\nIf all k regions have demand that is independent (Pij = 0) and identically distributed, with mean D and standard deviation a, Equation 11.13 can be simplified as \\nDe= kD a£= Vka (11.14) \\nThe required safety inventory at the centralized location is given as \\nRequired safety inventory on aggregation = Fs1( CSL) X vL X af; (11.15) \\nThe holding-cost savings on aggregation per unit sold are obtained by dividing the sav\\xadings in holding cost by the total demand kD.

Inventory savings on aggregation are always positive as long as the corre\\xadlation coefficients are less than 1. From Equation 11.16, we thus draw the following conclusions regarding the value of aggregation. \\n• The safety inventory savings on aggregation increase with the desired cycle service level CSL. \\n• The safety inventory savings on aggregation increase with the replenishment lead time L. \\n• The safety inventory savings on aggregation increase with the holding cost H. • The safety inventory savings on aggregation decrease as the correlation coeffi\\xadcients increase. \\nIn Example 11-7 we illustrate the inventory savings on aggregation and the impact of the correlation coefficient on these savings. \\nExample 11-7: Impact of correlation on value of aggregation A BMW dealership has four retail outlets serving the entire Chicago area (disaggregate option).

As a result, it has lower levels of book and music inventories than bookstore chains such as Borders and Barnes & Noble, which must keep inventory in every retail store. There are, however, situations where physical aggregation of inventories in one location may not be optimal. There are two major disadvantages of aggregating all inventories in one location: \\n1. Increase in response time to customer order \\n2. Increase in transportation cost to customer \\nBoth disadvantages result because the average distance between the inventory and the customer increases with aggregation. With this situation, either the customer has to travel more to reach the product or the product has to be shipped over longer distances to reach the customer. For example, a retail chain such as The Gap has the option of building many small retail outlets or a few large ones. The Gap tends to have many smaller outlets distributed evenly in a region because this strategy reduces the distance that customers travel to reach a store. If The Gap had one large centralized outlet, the average distance that customers need to travel would increase and thus the response time would increase. A desire to decrease customer response time is thu~ the impetus for the firm to have multiple outlets. Another example is McMaster~Carr, a distributor of MRO supplies. McMaster-Carr uses UPS for shipping product to customers. Because shipping charges are based on distance, having one centralized warehouse increases the average shipping cost as well as the response time to the customer. Thus, McMaster\\xadCarr has six warehouses that allow it to provide next-day delivery to a large fraction of the United States. Next-day delivery by UPS would not be feasible at a reasonable cost if McMaster- Carr had only one warehouse. Even Amazon.com, which started with one warehouse in Seattle, has added more warehouses in other parts of the United States in an effort to improve response time and reduce transportation cost to the customer. These examples highlight instances in which physical aggregation of inventory at one location may not be optimal. However, there are clear benefits to aggregating safety inventory. We now discuss various methods by which a supply chain can extract the ben\\xadefits of aggregation without having to physically centralize all inventories in one location. \\nINFORMATION CENTRALIZATION \\nMcMaster-Carr uses information centralization to virtually aggregate all its inventories despite having six stocking locations.

Consider, for \\nexample, a customer in Chicago ordering a motor and a pump. When the customer \\norder arrives, McMaster-Carr makes an initial check to see if the Chicago warehouse \\ncan fill the entire order. If so, the order is shipped from there to minimize response \\ntime and transportation cost. \\nIf the Chicago warehouse has motors but is out of pumps, McMaster-Carr obtains \\nthe pump from the closest warehouse that has the pump in inventory. The pump is \\nshipped from the warehouse to Chicago, where it is merged with the motor into a sin\\xad\\ngle shipment and sent to the customer. Thus, inventory at all locations is available to all \\norders, no matter where they originate. Information centralization allows McMaster\\xad\\nCarr to reduce the level of inventories required while providing a high level of product \\navailability by virtually aggregating inventories. \\nThe benefit of information centralization derives from the fact that most orders \\nare filled from the warehouse closest to the customer, keeping transportation costs low. \\nIn case of a stockout, other warehouses fill the order, improving product availability. \\nAs a result, McMaster-Carr can improve product availability without increasing its \\nsafety inventory while keeping shipping costs relatively low. \\nRetailers such as the Gap also use information centralization very effectively. If a \\nstore does not have the size or color that a customer wants, store employees can use \\ntheir information system to inform the customer of the closest store with the product in \\ninventory. Customers can then either go to this store or have the product delivered to \\ntheir house. The Gap thus uses information centralization to virtually aggregate inven\\xad\\ntory across all retail stores even though the inventory is physically separated. This \\nallows the Gap to reduce the amount of safety inventory it carries while providing a \\nhigh level of product availability. \\nWal-Mart has an information system in place that allows store managers to search \\nother stores for an excess of items that may be hot sellers at their stores. Wal-Mart pro\\xad\\nvides transportation that allows store managers to exchange products so they arrive at \\nstores where they are in high demand. In this case, Wal-Mart uses information central\\xad\\nization with a responsive transportation system to reduce the amount of safety inven\\xad\\ntory carried while providing a high level of product availability. \\nSPECIALIZATION \\nMost supply chains provide a variety of products to customers. When inventory is car\\xad\\nried '!t multiple locations, a key decision for a supply chain manager is whether all \\nproducts should be stocked at every location. Clearly, a product that does not sell in a \\ngeographic region should not be carried in inventory by the warehouse or retail store \\nlocated there. For example, it does not make sense for a Sears retail store in southern \\nFlorida to carry a wide variety of snow boots in inventory. \\nAnother important factor that must be considered when making stocking deci\\xad\\nsions is the reduction in safety inventory that results from aggregation. If aggregation \\nreduces the required safety inventory for a product by a large amount, it is better to \\ncarry the product in one central location. If aggregation reduces the required safety \\ninventory for a product by a small amount, it may be best to carry the product in mul-\\ntiple decentralized locations to reduce response time and transportation cost. . \\nThe reduction in safety inventory due to aggregation is strongly influenced by the \\ndemand's coefficient of variation. For a product with a very low coefficient of varia\\xad\\ntion, disaggregate demand can be forecast with accuracy. As a result, the benefit from \\naggregation is minimal.

We illustrate this idea in Example 11-8. \\nExample 11-8: Impact of coefficient of variation on value of aggregation Assume that W. W. Grainger, a supplier of MRO products, has 1 ,600 stores distributed throughout the United States. Consider two products-large electric motors and industrial cleaners. Large electric motors are high-value items with low demand, whereas the indus\\xadtrial cleaner is a low-value item with high demand. Each motor costs $SOO and each can of cleaner costs $30. Weekly demand for motors at each store is normally distributed, with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 40. Weekly demand for cleaner at each store is nor\\xadmally distributed, with a mean of 1 ,000 and a standard deviation of 100. Demand experi\\xadenced by each store is independent, and supply lead time for both motors and cleaner is four weeks. W.W. Grainger has a holding cost of 25 percent. For each of the two products, evaluate the reduction in safety inventories that will result if they are removed from retail stores and carried only in a centralized DC. Assume a desired CSL of 0.95. \\nAnalysis: The evaluation of safety inventories and the value of aggregation for each of the two products is shown in Table 11-4. All calculations use the approach discussed earlier and illustrated in Example 11-7. As Table 11-4 shows, the benefit from centralizing motors is much larger than the benefit from centralizing cleaner. From this analysis, W. W. Grainger should stock cleaner at the stores and motors in the DC. Given that cleaner is a high-demand item, customers will be able to pick it up on the same day at the stores.

The centralized location \\nthen specializes in handling slow-moving items. \\nOf course, other factors also need to be considered when deciding on the alloca\\xad\\ntion of products to stocking locations. For example, an item that is considered an emer\\xad\\ngency item because the customer needs it urgently may be stocked at stores even if it \\nhas a high coefficient of variation. One also needs to consider the cost of the item. \\nHigh-value items provide a greater benefit from centralization than low-value items. \\nIt is important for firms with bricks-and-mortar stores to take the idea of special\\xad\\nization into account when they design their e-commerce strategy. Consider, for exam\\xad\\nple, a bookstore chain such as Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble is able to carry about \\na hundred thousand titles at each retail store. The titles carried can be divided into two \\nbroad categories-best-sellers with high demand and other books with much lower \\ndemand. Barnes & Noble can design an e-commerce strategy under which the retail \\nstores carry primarily best-sellers in inventory. They also carry one or at most two \\ncopies of each of the other titles, to allow customers to browse. Customers can access \\nall titles that are not in the store via electronic kiosks in the store, which provide access \\nto barnesandnoble.com inventory. This strategy allows customers to access an \\nincreased variety of books from Barnes & Noble stores. Customers place orders for \\nlow-volume titles with barnesandnoble.com while purchasing high-volume titles at the \\nstore itself. This strategy of specialization allows Barnes & Noble to aggregate all-slow\\xad\\nmoving items to be sold by the online channel. All best-sellers are decentralized and \\ncarried close to the customer. The supply chain thus reduces inventory costs for slow\\xad\\nmoving items at the expense of somewhat higher transportation costs. For the fast\\xad\\nmoving items, the supply chain provides a lower transportation cost and better \\nresponse time by carrying the items at retail stores close to the customer. \\nThe Gap follows a similar strategy and integrates its online channel with its retail \\nstores. Terminals are available at the retail stores for placing orders online. The retail \\nstores carry fast-moving items and the customer is able to order slow-moving colors \\nor sizes online. The Gap is thus able to increase the variety of products available to cus\\xad\\ntomers while keeping supply chain inventories down. Walmart.com has also employed \\na strategy of carrying slower-moving items online. \\nPRODUCT SUBSTITUTION \\nSubstitution refers to the use of one product to satisfy demand for a different product. \\nThere are two instances where substitution may occur: \\n1. Manufacturer-driven substitution: In this case the manufacturer or supplier \\nmakes the decision to substitute. Typically, the manufacturer substitutes a higher\\xad\\nvalue product for a lower-value product that is not in inventory. For example, \\nDell may install a 120-gigabyte hard drive into a customer order requiring a \\n100-gigabyte drive, if the smaller drive is out of stock. \\n2. Customer-driven substitution: In this case customers make the decision to substi\\xad\\ntute. For example, a customer walking into a Wal-Mart store to buy a gallon of \\ndetergent may buy the half-gallon size if the gallon size is not available. In this case \\nthe customer substitutes the half-gallon size for the gallon size. \\nIn both cases, exploiting substitution allows the supply chain to satisfy demand \\nusing aggregate inventories, which permits the supply chain to reduce safety invento\\xad\\nries without hurting product availability.

Customers are charged according to the size of drive that \\nthey select, with larger sizes being more expensive. If a customer orders a 40-gigabyte \\ndrive and the PC manufacturer is out of drives of this size, there are two possible \\nchoices: (1) delay or deny the customer order or (2) substitute a larger drive that is in \\nstock (say, a 60-gigabyte drive) and fill the customer order on time. In the first case \\nthere is potentially a lost sale or loss of future sales because the customer experiences \\na delayed delivery. In the second case the manufacturer installs a higher-cost compo\\xad\\nnent, reducing the company's profit margin. These factors, along with the fact that only \\nlarger drives can substitute for smaller drives, must be considered when the manufac\\xad\\nturer makes inventory decisions for individual drive sizes. \\nSubstitution allows the PC manufacturer to aggregate demand across the compo\\xad\\nnents, reducing safety inventories required. The value of substitution increases as \\ndemand uncertainty increases. Thus, the PC manufacturer should consider substitution \\nfor components displaying very high demand uncertainty. \\nThe desired degree of substitution is influenced by the cost differential between the \\nhigher-value and lower-value component. If the cost differential is very small, the PC \\nmanufacturer should aggregate most of the demand and carry most of its inventory in \\nthe form of the higher-value component. As the cost differential increases, the benefit of \\nsubstitution decreases. In this case, the PC manufacturer will find it more profitable to \\ncarry inventory of each of the two components and decrease the amount of substitution. \\nThe desired level of substitution is also influenced by the correlation of demand \\nbetween the products. If demand between two components is strongly positively corre\\xad\\nlated, there is little value in substitution. As demand for the two components becomes \\nless positively correlated, the benefit of substitution increases. \\nCustomer-Driven Two-Way Substitution \\nConsider W.W. Grainger selling two brands of motors, GE and SE, which have very \\nsimilar performance characteristics. Customers are generally willing to purchase either \\nbrand, depending on product availability.lfW.W. Grainger managers do not recognize \\ncustomer substitution, they will not encourage it. For a given level of product availabil\\xad\\nity they will thus have to carry high levels of safety inventory of each brand. If its man\\xad\\nagers recognize and encourage customer substitution, they can aggregate the safety \\ninventory across the two brands, thereby improving product availability. \\nW.W. Grainger does a very good job of recognizing customer substitution. When a \\ncustomer calls or goes online to place an order and the product she requests is not \\navailable, the customer is immediately told the availability of all equivalent products \\nthat she may substitute. Most customers ultimately buy a substitute product in this \\ncase. W.W. Grainger exploits this substitution by managing safety inventory of all sub\\xad\\nstitutable products jointly.

Grainger to provide a high level of product availability with lower levels \\nof safety inventory. \\nA good understanding of customer-driven substitution is very important in the \\nretail industry. It must be exploited when merchandising to ensure that substitute \\nproducts are placed near each other, allowing a customer to buy one if the other is out \\nof stock. In the online channel, substitution requires a retailer to present the availabil\\xad\\nity of substitute products if the one the customer requests is out of stock. The supply \\nchain is thus able to reduce the required level of safety inventory while providing a \\nhigh level of product availability. \\nThe demand uncertainties as well as the correlation of demand between the sub\\xad\\nstitutable products influence the benefit to a retailer from exploiting substitution. The \\ngreater the demandimcertainty, the greater is the benefit ()f substitution. The lower the \\ncorrelation of demand between substitutable products, the greater is the benefit from \\nexploiting substitution. \\nCOMPONENT COMMONALITY \\nIn any supply chain, a significant amount of inventory is held in the form of components. \\nA single product such as a PC contains hundreds of components. When a supply chain is \\nproducing a large variety of products, component inventories can easily become very \\nlarge. The use of common components in a variety of products is an effective supply \\nchain strategy to exploit aggregation and reduce component inventories. \\nDell sells thousands of different PC configurations to customers. An extreme option \\nfor Dell is to design distinct components that are suited to the performance of a particular \\nconfiguration. In this case Dell would use different memory, hard drive, modem, and other \\ncomponents for each distinct finished product. The other option is to design products such \\nthat different combinations of the components result in different finished products. \\nWithout common components, the uncertainty of demand for any component is \\nthe same as the uncertainty of demand for the finished product in which it is used. \\nGiven the large number of components in each finished product, demand uncertainty \\nwill be very high, resulting in high levels of safety inventory. When products with com\\xad\\nmon components are designed, the demand for each component is an aggregation of \\nthe demand for all the finished products of which the component is a part. Component \\ndemand is thus more. predictable than the demand for any one finished product. This \\nfact reduces the component inventories carried in the supply chain. This idea has been \\na key factor for success in the PC industry and has also started to play a big role in the \\nauto industry. With increasing product variety, component commonality is a key to \\nreducing supply chain inventories without hurting product availability. We illustrate \\nthe basic idea behind component commonality in Example 11-9. \\nExample 11-9: Value of component commonality \\nAssume that Dell is to manufacture 27 different PCs with three distinct components: processor, memory, and hard drive. Under the disaggregate option, Dell designs specific components for each PC, resulting in 3 x 27 = 81 distinct components. Under the common-component option, Dell designs PCs such that three distinct processors, three distinct memory units, and three distinct hard drives can be combined to create 27 different'),\n",

Each component is thus used in nine different PCs. Monthly demand for each of the 27 different PCs is independent and normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a stan\\xaddard deviation of 3,000. The replenishment lead time for each component is one month. Dell is targeting a CSL of 95 percent for component inventory. Evaluate the safety inventory requirements with and without the use of component commonality. Also evaluate the change in safety inventory requirements as the number of finished products of which a component is a part varies from one to nine. \\nAnalysis: We first evaluate the disaggregate option, in which components are specific to a PC. For each component we have \\nStandard deviation of monthly demand = 3,000 \\nGiven a lead time of one month and a total of 81 components across 27 different PCs, we thus use Equation 11.12 to obtain \\nTotal safety inventory required = 81 X NORMS/NV(0.95) x V1 x 3,000 = 399,699 units \\nIn the case of component commonality, each component ends up in nine different finished products. Therefore, the demand at the component level is the sum of demand across nine different products. Using Equations 11.14 and 11.15, the safety inventory required for each component is thus \\nSafety inventory per common component = NORMSINV(0.95) x V1 x v'9 x 3,000 \\n= 14,804 units \\nWith component commonality there are a total of nine distinct components. The total safety inventory across all nine components is thus \\nTotal safety inventory required = 9 x 14,804 = 133,236 \\nThus, having each component common to nine different products results in a reduction in safety inventory for Dell from 399,735 to 133,236 units. \\nIn Table 11-5, we evaluate the marginal benefit in terms of reduction in safety inventory as a result of increasing component commonality. Starting with the required safety inventory when each component is used in only one finished product, we evaluate the safety inventory as the number of products in which a component is used increases to nine. Observe that component commonality decreases the required safety inventory for Dell. The marginal benefit of commonality, however, declines as a component is used in more and more finished products. \\nAs a component is used in more finished products, it needs to be more flexible. As \\na result, the cost of producing the component typically increases with increasing com\\xad\\nmonality. Given that the marginal benefit of component commonality decreases as we \\nincrease commonality, we need to trade off the increase in component cost and the \\ndecrease in safety inventory when deciding on the appropriate level of component \\ncommonality. \\nNumber of Finished Safety Marginal Reduction Total Reduction Products per Component Inventory in Safety Inventory in SafetY Inventory \\n1 399,699 \\n2 282,630 117,069 117,069 \\n3 230,766 51,864 168,933 \\n4 199,849 30,917 199,850 \\n5 178,751 21,098 220,948 \\n6 163,176 15,575 236,523 \\n7 151,072 12,104 248,627 \\n8 141,315 9,757 258,384 \\n9 133,233 8,082 266,466 \\n-----~-------\\n- ------------·-~---~--· - --·~-------\"),\n",

The goal is to have common \\ncomponents in the supply chain for most of the push phase and move product differ\\xad\\nentiation as close to the pull phase of the supply chain as possible. For example, Dell \\nholds all inventory in the form of components that are common across many PC con\\xad\\nfigurations. A PC is assembled in the pull phase of the supply chain, after the customer \\norder arrives. Thus, Dell produces product variety only when demand is known with \\ncertainty. Postponement coupled with component commonality allows Dell to carry \\nsignificantly lower safety inventories than a manufacturer such as HP that sells \\nthrough retailers. Given that HP must stock finished inventory at the retailer, it assem\\xad\\nbles to stock. Thus, HP must forecast demand for each individual configuration when \\nassembling. The assemble-to-order direct sales model of Dell relies on aggregate \\ninventories in the form of components, whereas the assemble-to-stock, sell-through \\nretailers model relies on disaggregate inventories for each PC configuration. \\nAnother classic example of postponement is the production process at Benetton to \\nmake colored knit garments. The original process called for the thread to be dyed and \\nthen knitted and assembled into garments. The entire process required up to six \\nmonths. Because the color of the final garment was fixed the moment the thread was \\ndyed, demand for individual colors had to be forecast far in advance (up to six months). \\nBenetton developed a manufacturing technology that allowed it to dye knitted gar\\xad\\nments to the appropriate color. Now greige thread (the term used for thread that has \\nnot yet been dyed) can be purchased, knitted, and assembled into garments before \\ndyeing. The dyeing of the garments is done much closer to the selling season. In fact, \\npart of the dyeing is done after the start of the selling season, when demand is known \\nwith great accuracy. In this case Benetton has postponed the color customization of the \\nknit garments. When thread is purchased, only the aggregate demand across all colors \\nneeds to be forecast. Given that this decision is made far in advance, when forecasts are \\nleast likely to be accurate, there is great advantage to this aggregation. However, as \\nBenetton moves closer to the selling season, the forecast uncertainty reduces. At the \\ntime·Benetton dyes the knit garments, demand is known with a high degree of accu\\xad\\nracy. Thus, postponement allows Benetton to exploit aggregation and significantly \\nreduce the level of safety inventory carried. Supply chain flows with and without post\\xad\\nponement are illustrated in Figure 11-5. \\nWithout component commonality and postponement, product differentiation \\noccurs early on in the supply chain and most of the supply chain inventories are disag\\xad\\ngregate. Postponement allows the supply chain to delay product differentiation. As a \\nresult, most of the inventories in the supply chain are aggregate. Postponement thus \\nallows a supply chain to exploit aggregation to reduce safety inventories without hurt\\xad\\ning product availability. \\nPostponement can be a powerful concept for the e-commerce channel. When \\nordering over the Internet, customers are implicitly willing to wait a little for the order \\nto arrive. This delay offers the supply chain an opportunity to reduce inventories by \\npostponing product differentiation until after the customer order arrives. It is impor\\xad\\ntant that the manufacturing process be designed in a way that enables assembly to be\"),\n",

We highlight the fact that periodic review poli\\xadcies require more safety inventory than continuous review policies for the same level of product availability. To simplify the discussion, we focus on the CSL as the measure of product availability. The managerial implications are the same if we use fill rate; the analysis, however, is more cumbersome. \\nCONTINUOUS REVIEW POLICIES \\nGiven that continuous review policies were discussed in detail in Section 11.2, we only reiterate the main points here. When using a continuous review policy, a manager orders Q units when the inventory drops to the ROP. Clearly, a continuous review policy requires technology that monitors the level of available inventory. This is.the case for many firms such as Wal-Mart and Dell, whose inventories are monitored continuously. Given a desired CSL, our goal is to identify the required safety inventory ss and the ROP. We-assume that demand is normally distributed, with the following inputs: \\nD: Average demand per period \\nav: Standard deviation of demand per period \\nL: Average lead time for replenishment \\nThe ROP represents the available inventory to meet demand during the lead time L. A stockout occurs if the demand during the lead time is larger than the ROP. If demand across periods is independent, demand during the lead time is normally distributed with the following: \\nMean demand during lead time, D L = D L \\nStandard deviation of demand during lead time, aL = VLav \\nGiven the desired CSL, the required safety inventory (ss) given by Equation 11.9 and the ROP given by Equation 11.3 are \\nss = Fs-1(CSL) X aL = NORMSINV(CSL) X aL,ROP = DL + ss'),\n",

This is because the continuous monitoring of \\ninventory allows the manager to adjust the timing of the replenishment order, depend\\xad\\ning on the demand experienced. If demand is very high, inventory reaches the ROP \\nquickly, leading to a quick replenishment order. If demand is very low, inventory drops \\nslowly to the ROP, leading to a delayed replenishment order. The manager, however, \\nhas no recourse during the lead time once a replenishment order has been placed. The \\navailable safety inventory thus must cover for the uncertainty of demand over this \\nperiod. \\nTypically, in continuous review policies the lot size ordered is kept fixed between \\nreplenishment cycles. The optimal lot size may be evaluated using the EOQ formula \\ndiscussed in Chapter 10. \\nPERIODIC REVIEW POLICIES \\nIn periodic review policies, inventory levels are reviewed after a fixed period of time T \\nand an order is placed such that the level of current inventory plus the replenishment \\nlot size equals a prespecified level called the order-up-to level (OUL). The review inter\\xad\\nval is the time T between successive orders. Observe that the size of each order may \\nvary, depending on the demand experienced between successive orders and the result\\xad\\ning inventory at the time of ordering. Periodic review policies are simpler for retailers \\nto implement because they do not require that the retailer have the capability of mon\\xad\\nitoring inventory continuously. Suppliers may also prefer them because they result in \\nreplenishment orders placed at regular intervals. \\nLet us consider the store manager at Wal-Mart who is responsible for designing a \\nreplenishment policy for Lego building blocks. He wants to analyze the impact on \\nsafety inventory if he decides to use a periodic review policy. Demand for Legos is nor\\xad\\nmally distributed and independent from one week to the next. We assume the follow\\xad\\ning inputs: \\nD: Average demand per period \\naD: Standard deviation of demand per period \\nL: Average lead time for replenishment \\nT: Review interval \\nCSL: Desired cycle service level \\nTo understand the safety inventory requirement, we track the sequence of events \\nover time as the store manager places orders. The store manager places the first order at \\ntime 0 such that the lot size ordered and the inventory on hand sum to the order-up-to \\nlevel, OUL. Once an order is placed, the replenishment lot arrives after the lead time L. \\nThe next review period is time T, when the store manager places the next order, which \\nthen arrives at time T + L. The OUL represents the inventory available to meet all \\ndemand that arises between periods 0 and T + L.

The replenishment lead time is two weeks, and the store manager has decided to review inventory every four weeks. Assuming a periodic\\xadreview replenishment policy, evaluate the safety inventory that the store should carry to provide a CSL of 90 percent. Evaluate the OUL for such a policy. \\nAnalysis: In this case, we have \\nAverage demand per period, D = 2,500 \\nStandard deviation of demand per period, a0 = 500 \\nAverage lead time for replenishment, L = 2 weeks \\nReview interval, T = 4 weeks \\nWe first obtain the distribution of demand during the time interval T + L.

With a continuous review policy, the safety inventory is used to cover for demand uncertainty over the lead time L. With a periodic review policy, the safety inventory is used to cover for demand uncertainty over the lead time and the review interval L + T. Given that higher uncertainty must be accounted for, periodic review policies require a higher level of safety inventory. This argument can be con\\xadfirmed by comparing the results in Examples 11.4 and 11.10. For a 90 percent CSL, the store manager requires a safety inventory of 906 boxes when using a continuous review and a safety inventory of 1,570 boxes when using a periodic review. \\n----------------~- -------\"),\n",

Given the broad use of bar codes and point-of-sale systems as well as the emergence of RFID technology, continuous \\ntracking of all inventories is much more commonplace today than it was a decade ago. In some instances companies partition their products based on their value. High-value \\nproducts are managed using continuous review policies and low-value products are managed using periodic review policies. This makes sense if the cost of perpetual track\\xading of inventory is more than the savings in safety inventory that result from switching all products to a continuous review policy. \\n11 .6 MANAGING SAFETY INVENTORY \\nIN A MULTIECHELON SUPPLY CHAIN \\nIn our discussion so far, we have assumed that each stage of the supply chain has a well-defined demand and supply distribution that it uses to set its safety inventory lev\\xadels. In practice, this is not true for multiechelon supply chains. Consider a simple multi\\xadechelon supply chain with a supplier feeding a retailer who sells to the final customer. The retailer needs to know demand as well as supply uncertainty to set safety inven\\xadtory levels. Supply uncertainty, however, is influenced by the level of safety inventory \\nthe supplier chooses to carry. If a retailer order arrives when the supplier has enough inventory, the supply lead time is short. In contrast, if the retailer order arrives when the supplier is out of stock, the replenishment lead time for the retailer increases. Thus, if the supplier increases its level of safety inventory, the retailer can reduce the safety inventory it holds. This implies that the level of safety inventory at all stages in a multi\\xadechelon supply chain should be related. \\nAll inventory between a stage and the final customer is called the echelon inven\\xadtory. Echelon inventory at a retailer is just the inventory at the retailer or in the pipeline coming to the retailer. Echelon inventory at a distributor, however, includes inventory at the distributor and all retailers served by the distributor. In a multieche\\xadlon setting, reorder points and order-up-to levels at any stage should be based on ech\\xadelon inventory and not local inventory. Thus, a distributor should decide its safety inventory levels based on the level of safety inventory carried by all retailers supplied by it. The more safety inventory retailers carry, the less safety inventory the distribu\\xadtor needs to carry. As retailers decrease the level of safety inventory they carry, the distributor has to increase its safety inventory to ensure regular replenishment at the retailers. \\nIf all stages in a supply chain attempt to manage their echelon inventory, the issue of how the inventory is divided among various stages becomes important. Carrying inventory upstream in a supply chain allows for more aggregation and thus reduces the amount of inventory required. Carrying inventory upstream, however, increases the probability that the final customer will have to wait because product is not available at a stage close to him. Thus, in a multiechelon supply chain a decision must be made with regard to the level of safety inventory carried at different stages. If inventory is very expensive to hold and customers are willing to tolerate a delay, it is better to increase the amount of safety inventory carried upstream, far from the final customer, to exploit the benefits of aggregation. If inventory is inexpensive to hold and customers are very time sensitive, it is better to carry more safety inventory downstream, closer to the final customer.'),\n",

Until the 1980s, inventory was generally managed using rules of thumb such as holding three months of demand in the warehouse. These levels were often (although not always) far from appropriate, resulting in too much of the wrong items and too little of the right ones. The errors were often very large when products had high demand vari\\xadability or varying levels of criticality. A second major contributor to excess inventories was the fact that each location managed its inventories independently, ignoring inven\\xadtories at other facilities. The end result was a bloated inventory system with relatively poor service levels. \\nThe first contribution of IT systems was to move inventory management from rules of thumb to setting inventories based on historical demand and desired service levels. IT systems allowed this analysis for potentially millions of SKUs and for the inventory levels to be recalculated as demand changed. The ability to analyze and change inventories in response to changes in demand often resultsin significantly lower inventories and improved service levels at the same time. Over time, IT inven\\xadtory management systems have evolved to incorporate more sophisticated techniques for managing inventory. They include different types of demand distributions beyond the normal distribution to better model demand. \\nOne of the major improvements since the mid-1990s has been the incorporation of multiechelon modeling that allows the analysis of inventories across the supply chain network rather than at each separate location. Local analysis often leads to duplication of inventories because each location sets its inventory levels independently. Multiechelon analysis, in contrast, attempts to reduce total network inventories by positioning inventories appropriately. More advanced companies have linked their inventory systems to those of their suppliers and customers. This is important, as the amount of inventory you want to hold depends on how much your customer holds and how much your suppliers have or what they are producing. IT systems also allow inventory management applications to be linked to production planning so that inven\\xadtory decisions are taken in conjunction with production decisions. With the growth in product variety, decrease in product life cycles, and rapid fluc\\xadtuations in demand, it is almost impossible to manage inventories today without the use of IT systems. ITsystems improve inventory management through their ability to act on a large number of products, to be frequently updated, and finally, to coordinate with other demand and supply planning systems both within the enterprise and across the supply chain. \\nThere is, however, plenty of room for improvement in inventory management sys\\xadtems. One area for improvement is the modeling of demand in different circumstances. The use of oversimplified demand distributions is often inaccurate and can even lead to inventory levels that are worse than the use of rules of thumb. As an example, con\\xadsider stocking demand for spare parts in a production facility. The mean demand for a part might be quite low, but when it is needed, not only is it critical, but perhaps a spe\\xadcific set of other parts are also needed. Modeling the demand as normal and indepen\\xaddent across parts is likely to give poor results. \\nAnother area for improvement in inventory management systems is the integra\\xadtion with other IT systems across the supply chain. Inventory buffers the variation of demand and supply within the supply chain. Thus, if inventory management systems do not communicate seamlessly with other planning and execution systems, inventory'),\n",

In particular, it is important that inventory manage\\xad\\nment systems communicate with demand planning systems to incorporate the impact \\nof seasonality and promotions. The inability of inventory management systems to pro\\xad\\nvide visibility and communicate effectively with other IT systems is often the biggest \\nhurdle to their success. \\nGiven the importance of inventories, vendors of inventory management systems \\nare the core supply chain management software providers. These firms include ERP \\nvendors SAP and Oracle and best-of-breed supply chain vendors i2 Technologies and \\nManugistics. There are also a number of niche companies that focus on various indus\\xad\\ntries, such as retail, high tech, and industrial manufacturing, that have a major inven\\xad\\ntory management component. \\nIn summary, inventory management systems have played a central role in improv\\xad\\ning supply chain performance. The significance of IT is likely to grow in the future as \\nmore supply chain partners are beginning to set their inventory levels based on their \\npartners' inventory and capabilities. \\n11.8 ESTIMATING AND MANAGING SAFETY \\nINVENTORY IN PRACTICE \\n1. Account for the fact that supply chain demand is lumpy. In practice, a manufacturer \\nor distributor does not order one unit at a time but instead often orders in a large lot. \\nThus, demand observed by different stages of the supply chain tends to be lumpy. \\nLumpiness adds to the variability of demand. Lumpiness of demand is not a significant \\nissue when using periodic review policies. When using a continuous review policy, how\\xad\\never, lumpiness may lead to inventory dropping far below the ROP before a replenish\\xad\\nment order is placed. On average, inventory will drop below the ROP by half the average \\nsize of an order. The lumpiness can be accounted for in practice by raising the safety \\ninventory suggested by the models discussed earlier by half the average size of an order. \\n2. Adjust inventory policies if demand is seasonal: In practice, demand is often sea\\xad\\nsonal, with the mean and the standard deviation of demand varying by the time of year. \\nThus, a given reorder point or order up to level may correspond to ten days of demand \\nduring the low-demand season and only two days of demand during the peak demand \\nseason. If the lead time is one week, stock outs are certain to occur during the peak sea\\xad\\nson. In the presence of seasonality, it is not appropriate to select an average demand \\nand standard deviation over the year to evaluate fixed reorder points and order-up-to \\nlevels. Both the mean and the standard deviation of demand must be adjusted by the \\ntime of year to reflect changing demand. Corresponding adjustments in the reorder \\npoints, order-up-to levels, and safety inventories must be made over the year. \\nAdjustments for changes in the mean demand over the year are generally more signif\\xad\\nicant than adjustments for changes in variability. \\n3. Use simulation to test inventory policies. Given that demand is most likely not \\nnormally distributed and may be seasonal, it is a good idea to test and adjust inventory \\npolicies using a computer simulation before they are implemented. The simulation \\nshould use a demand pattern that truly reflects actual demand, including any lumpiness \\nas well as seasonality. The inventory policies obtained using the models discussed in the \\nchapter can then be tested and adjusted if needed to obtain the desired service levels. \\nSurprisingly powerful simulations can be built using Excel, as we discuss in Chapter 12. \\nIdentifying problems in a simulation can save a lot of time and money compared to fac\\xad\\ning these problems once the inventory policy is in place. \\n--- --~-------~-------------\"),\n",

Start with a pilot. Even a simulation cannot identify all problems that may arise when using an inventory policy. Once an inventory policy has been selected and tested using simulation, it is often a good idea to start implementation with a pilot program of products that are representative of the entire set of products in inventory. By starting with a pilot, many of the problems (both in the inventory policies themselves and in the process of applying the policies) can be solved. Getting these problems solved before the policy is rolled out to all the products can save a lot of time and money. \\n5. Monitor service levels. Once an inventory policy has been implemented, it is impor\\xadtant that its performance be tracked and monitored. Monitoring is crucial because it allows a supply chain to identify when a policy is not working well and make adjust\\xadments before supply chain performance is affected significantly. Monitoring requires not just tracking the inventory levels but also tracking any stockouts that may result. Historically, firms have not tracked stockouts very well, partly because stockouts are difficult to track and partly because there is the perception that stockouts affect the customer but not the firm itself. Stockouts can be difficult to measure in a situation such as a supermarket, where the customer simply does not buy the product when it is not on the shelf. However, there are simple ways to estimate stockouts.At a supermar\\xadket, the fraction of time that a shelf does not contain a product may be used to estimate the fill rate. Stock outs are in fact easier to estimate online, where the number of clicks on an out-of-stock product can be measured. Given the fraction of clicks that turn into orders and the average size of an order, demand during a stockout can be estimated. \\n6. Focus on reducing safety inventories. Given that safety inventory is often a large fraction of the total inventory in a supply chain, the ability to reduce safety inventory without hurting product availability can significantly increase supply chain profitabil\\xadity. This is particularly important in the high-tech industry, where product life cycles are short. In this chapter we discussed a variety of managerial levers that can help reduce safety inventories without hurting availability. Supply chain managers must focus con\\xadtinuously on using these levers to reduce safety inventories. \\n11.9 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Understand the role of safety inventory in a supply chain. \\nSafety inventory helps a supply chain provide customers a high level of product avail\\xadability in}pite of supply and demand variability. It is carried just in case demand exceeds the amount forecasted or supply arrives later than expected. \\n2. Identify factors that influence the required level of safety inventory. \\nSafety inventory is influenced by demand uncertainty, replenishment lead times, lead time variability, and desired product availability. As any one of them increases, the required safety inventory also increases. The required safety inventory is also influenced by the inventory policy implemented. Continuous review policies require less safety inventory than periodic review policies. \\n3. Describe different measures of product availability. \\nThe three basic measures of product availability are product fill rate, order fill rate, and cycle service level. Product fill rate is the fraction of demand for a product that is success\\xadfully filled. Order fill rate is the fraction of orders that are completely filled. Cycle service level is the fraction of replenishment cycles in which no stockouts occur. 4. Utilize managerial levers available to lower safety inventory and improve product availability. The required level of safety inventory may be reduced and product availability may be improved if a supply chain can reduce demand variability, replenishment lead times, and the \\n-----·----'),\n",

Toyota has decided to set up regional warehouses where some variants of the Scion will be customized and shipped to dealers on demand. Customizing and shipping on demand will raise production and transportation cost per car by $100. Each car costs $20,000, and Toyota \\nhas a holding cost of 20 percent. Cars at the dealer are owned by Toyota for the fist 90 days. \\nThus, for all practical purposes, Toyota owns all inventory, whether at the dealers or at the regional warehouse. Consider a region with five large dealers and 30 small dealers. Toyota has partitioned the variants into two groups-popular variants and uncommon variants. Weekly \\ndemand for the two types of variants in the two types of dealers is shown in Table 11-7. The \\ngoal is to provide a 95 percent ~ycle service level using a continuous review policy.

Orion is a global company that sells copiers. Orion currently sells 10 variants of a copier, with all inventory kept in finished-goods form. The primary component that differentiates \\nthe copiers is the printing subassembly. An idea being discussed is to introduce commonality \\nin the printing subassembly so that final assembly can be postponed and inventories kept in component form. Currently, each copier costs $1,000 in terms of components. Introducing \\ncommonality in the print subassembly will increase component costs to $1,025. One of the 10 variants represents 80 percent of the total demand. Weekly demand for this variant is nor\\xad\\nmally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200.

All production occurred at three facilities \\nlocated in the Cleveland area. For sales purposes, the con\\xad\\ntinental United States was divided into five regions, as \\nshown in Figure 11-6. A DC owned by ALKO operated in \\neach of these regions. Customers placed orders with the \\nDCs, which tried to supply them from product in inven\\xad\\ntory. As the inventory for any product diminished, the DC \\nin turn ordered from the plants. The plants scheduled \\nproduction based on DC orders. Orders were transported \\nfrom plants to the DCs in TL quantities because order \\nsizes tended to be large. On the other hand, shipments \\nfrom the DC to the customer were LTL. ALKO used a \\nthird-party trucking company for both transportation \\nlegs. In 1999, TL costs from the plants to DCs averaged \\n$0.09 per unit. LTL shipping costs from a DC to a cus\\xad\\ntomer averaged $0.10 per unit. On average, five days \\nwere necessary between the time a DC placed an order \\nwith a plant and the time the order was delivered from \\nthe plant . \\nThe policy in 1999 was to stock each item in every \\nDC. A detailed study of the product line had shown that \\nthere were three basic categories of products in terms of \\nthe volume of sales. They were categorized as types High, \\n341'),\n",

Use managerial levers that improve supply chain profitability through optimal service levels. \\nI\\nn this chapter, we explore the process of determining the optimal level of product \\navailability to be offered to customers. The chapter examines the components that \\ngo into the calculation of the optimal service level and the various ways that this calcu\\xad\\nlation can be performed. We discuss and demonstrate how different managerial levers \\ncan be used to improve supply chain profitability by increasing the level of product \\navailability while reducing inventories. \\n12.1 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEVEL \\nOF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY \\nThe level of product availability is measured using the cycle service level or the fill rate, \\nwhich are metrics for the amount of customer demand satisfied from available inven\\xad\\ntory. Tlie level of product availability, also referred to as the customer service level, is \\none of the primary measures of a supply chain's responsiveness. A supply chain can use \\na high level of product availability to improve its responsiveness and attract customers, \\nthus increasing revenue for the supply chain. However, a high level of product avail\\xad\\nability requires large inventories, which raises supply chain costs. Therefore, a supply \\nchain must achieve a balance between the level of availability and the cost of inven\\xad\\ntory. The optimal level of product availability is one that maximizes supply chain \\nprofitability. \\nWhether the optimal level of availability is high or low depends on where a partic\\xad\\nular company believes it can maximize profits. For example, Nordstrom has focused on \\nproviding a high level of product availability and has used its reputation for respon\\xad\\nsiveness to become a very successful department store chain. However, prices at \\nNordstrom are higher than at a discount store, where the level of product availability is \\nlower. Power plants ensure that they (almost) never run out of fuel because a shut\\xad\\ndown is extremely expensive, resulting in several days of lost production. Some power \\nplants try to maintain several months of fuel supply to avoid any probability of running \\nout. In contrast, most supermarkets carry only a few days' supply of product, and out\\xad\\nof-stock situations do occur with some frequency. \\n---~-~-----\"),\n",

This competitive environment puts pressure on Web retailers to increase their level of availability. Simultaneously, signifi\\xadcant price competition has lowered prices on the Web. Web retailers with excess inven\\xadtory find it difficult to be profitable. Providing the optimal level of product availability is thus a key to success on the Web. · \\nIn the examples described earlier, firms provide different levels of product avail\\xadability. Every supply chain manager must use factors that influence the optimal level of product availability to target the optimal level of product availability and identify man\\xadagerial levers that increase supply chain surplus. Next we identify factors that affect the optimal level of product availability. \\n12.2 FACTORS AFFECTING OPTIMAL LEVEL \\nOF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY \\nTo understand the factors that influence the optimal level of product availability, con\\xadsider L.L.Bean, a large mail-order company that sells apparel. One of the products L.L.Bean sells is ski jackets. The selling season for ski jackets is from November to February. The buyer at L.L.Bean currently purchases the entire season's supply of ski jackets from the manufacturer before the start of the selling season. Providing a high level of product availability requires the purchase of a large number of jackets. Although a high level of product availability is likely to satisfy all demand that arises, it is also likely to result in a large number of unsold jackets at the end of the season, with L.L.Bean losing money on unsold jackets. In contrast, a low level of product availabil\\xadity is likely to result in few unsold jackets. However, it is quite likely that L.L.Bean will have to turn away customers willing to buy jackets because they are sold out. In this scenario, L.L.Bean loses potential profit by losing customers. The buyer at L.L.Bean must balance the loss from having too many unsold jackets (in case the number of jack\\xadets ordered is more than demand) and the lost profit from turning away customers (in case the number of jackets ordered is less than demand) when deciding the level of product availability. \\nThe cost of overstocking is denoted by C 0 and is the loss incurred by a firm for each unsold unit at the end of the selling season. The cost of understacking is denoted by Cu and is th~ margin lost by a firm for each lost sale because there is no inventory on hand. The cost of understacking should include the margin lost from current as well as future sales if the customer does not return. In summary, the two key factors that influence the optimal level of product availability are \\n• Cost of overstocking the product \\n• Cost of understacking the product \\nWe illustrate and develop this relationship in the context of a buying decision at L.L.Bean. The first point to observe is that deciding on an optimal level of product availability makes sense only in the context of demand uncertainty. Traditionally, many firms have forecast a consensus estimate of demand without any measure of uncer\\xadtainty. In this setting, firms do not make a decision regarding the level of availability; they simply order the consensus forecast. Over the last decade, firms have developed a better appreciation for uncertainty and have started developing forecasts that include a measure of uncertainty. Incorporating uncertainty and deciding on the optimal level of product availability can increase profits relative to using a consensus forecast. \\n---· -···--·---· \\n------------------·\"),\n",

Based on demand over the past few years, the buyers have estimated the demand distribution for a women's red ski parka to be as shown in Table 12-1. This is a deviation from their traditional practice of using the average historical demand as the consensus forecast. To simplify the discussion, we assume that all demand is in hun\\xaddreds of parkas. The manufacturer also requires that L.L.Bean place orders in multi\\xadples of 100. In Table 12-1, Pi is the probability that demand equals Di> and Pi is the probability that demand is less than or equal to Di. From Table 12-1, we evaluate the expected demand of Parkas as \\nExpected demand = ~DiPi = 1,026 \\nUnder the old policy of ordering the expected value, the buyers would have ordered 1,000 parkas. However, demand is uncertain and Table 12-1 shows that there is a 51 percent probability that demand will be 1,000 or less. Thus, a policy of ordering a thousand parkas results in a cycle service level of 51 percent at L.L.Bean. The buying committee must decide on an order size and cycle service level that maximizes the profits from the sale of parkas at L.L.Bean. \\nThe loss that L.L.Bean incurs from an unsold parka as well as the profit that L.L.Bean makes on each parka it sells influence the buying decision. Each parka costs L.L.Bean c = $45 and is priced in the catalog at p = $100. Any unsold parkas at the end of the season are sold at the outlet store for $50. Holding the parka in inventory and transporting it to the outlet store costs L.L.Bean $10. Thus, L.L.Bean recovers a sal\\xadvage value of s = $40 for each parka that is unsold at the end of the season. L.L.Bean makes a profit of p - c = $55 on each parka it sells and incurs a loss of c - s = $5 on each unsold parka that is sent to the outlet store. \\nThe expected profit from ordering a thousand parkas is given as \\n10 \\nExpectedprofit = ~[Di(P- c)-(1,000-Di)(c-s)]pi i=4 \\n17 \\n+ i?i\\n1\\n1,000(p - c)pi = $49,900\"),\n",

If 1,100 parkas are ordered, the extra 100 are sold (for a profit of $5,500) if demand is 1,100 or higher. Otherwise the extra 100 units are sent to the outlet store at a loss of $500. From Table 12-1, we see that there is a probability of0.49 that demand is 1,100 or higher and a 0.51 probability that demand is 1,000 or less. Thus, we deduce the following: \\nExpected profit from the extra 100 parkas = 5,500 X Prob(demand > 1,100) - 500 X Prob(demand < 1,100) = $5,500 X 0.49 - $500 X 0.51 = $2,440 \\nThe total expected profit from ordering 1,100 parkas is thus $52,340, which is almost 5 percent higher than the expected profit from ordering 1,000 parkas. Using the same approach, we evaluate the marginal contribution of each additional100 parkas as in Table 12-2. Note that the expected marginal contribution is positive up to 1,300 parkas, but it is negative from that point on. Thus the optimal order size is 1,300 parkas. From Table 12-2 we have \\nExpected profit from ordering 1,300 parkas = $49,900 + $2,440 \\n+ $1,240 + $580 = $54,160 \\nThis is over an 8 percent increase in profitability relative to the policy of ordering the expected value of 1,000 parkas. \\nA plot of total expected profits versus the order quantity is shown in Figure 12-1. The optimal order quantity maximizes the expected profit. For L.L.Bean, the optimal order quantity is 1,300 parkas, which provides a CSL of 92 percent. Observe that with a CSL of 0.92, L.LBean has a fill rate that is much higher. If demand is 1,300 or less, L.L.Bean achieves a fill rate of 100 percent, because all demand is satisfied.

In this case a fill rate of 1,300/D is \\nachieved. Overall, the fill rate achieved at L.L.Bean if 1,300 parkas are ordered is given by \\nfr = 1 X Prob(demand ::::: 1,300) + 2: (1,300/Di)pi = 0.99 \\nDi>1,300 \\nThus, with a policy of ordering 1,300 parkas, L.L.Bean satisfies, on average, 99 per\\xad\\ncent of its demand from parkas in inventory. \\nIn the L.L.Bean example we have a cost of overstocking of C 0 = c - s = $5 and a \\ncost of understacking of Cu = p - c = $55. As these costs change, the optimal level of \\nproduct availability also changes. In the next section we develop the relationship between \\nthe desired CSL and the cost of overstocking and understacking for seasonal items. \\nOPTIMAL CYCLE SERVICE LEVEL FOR SEASONAL ITEMS \\nWITH A SINGLE ORDER IN A SEASON \\nIn this section we focus attention on seasonal products such as ski jackets, for which all \\nleftover items must be disposed of at the end of the season. The assumption is that the \\nleftover items from the previous season are not used to satisfy demand for the current \\nseason. Assume a retail price per unit of p, a cost of c, and a salvage value of s. We con\\xad\\nsider the following inputs: \\nC 0 : Cost of overstocking by one unit, C 0 = c - s \\nCu: Cost of understacking by one unit, Cu = p - c \\nCSL *: Optimal cycle service level \\no*: Corresponding optimal order size \\nCSL *is the probability that demand during the season will be at or below o*. At the \\noptimal cycle service level CSL *,the marginal contribution of purchasing an additional \\nunit is zero. If the order quantity is raised from o* to o* + 1, the additional unit sells if \\ndemand is larger than o*. This occurs with probability 1 - CSL * and results in a con\\xad\\ntribution of p - c. We thus have \\nExpected benefit of purchasing extra unit = ( 1 - CS L *) (p - c) \\nThe additional unit remains unsold if demand is at or below o*. This occurs with \\nprobability CSL *and results in a cost of c - s. We thus have \\nExpected cost of purchasing extra unit = CSL *(c - s) \\nThus, the expected marginal contribution of raising the order size from o* to o* + 1 \\nis given by \\n(1 - CSL*)(p -c) - CSL*(c- s) \\nBecause the expected marginal contribution must be 0 at the optimal cycle service \\nlevel, we have \\n* * p - C Cu CSL = Prob(Demand ::::: 0 ) = --= C p - S Cu + o \\n1 (12.1) \\nA more rigorous derivation of the aforementioned formula is provided in \\nAppendix 12A. The optimal CSL *has also been referred to as the critical fractile. The \\nresulting optimal order quantity maximizes the firm's profit. If demand during the sea\\xad\\nson is normally distributed, with a mean of 1-L and a standard deviation of a, the optimal \\norder quantity is given by \\no* = p-1(CSL*, 1-L· a) = NORMINV(CSL*, !L, a) (12.2)\"),\n",

Based on past demand data and weather forecasts for the \\nyear, management has forecast demand to be normally distributed, with a mean of \\nfJ.. = 350 and a standard deviation of u = 100. Each pair of skis costs c = $100 and retails \\nfor p = $250. Any unsold skis at the end of the season are disposed of for $85.

How many skis should the \\nmanager order to maximize expected profits? \\nAnalysis: In this case we have \\nSalvage values = $85 - $5 = $80 \\nCost of understacking = Cu = p - c = $250 - $100 = $150 \\nCost of overstocking = C 0 = c - s = $100 - $80 = $20 \\nUsing Equation 12.1, we deduce that the optimal CSL is \\n* * Cu 150 CSL = Prob(Demand ::; 0 ) = = = 0.88 Cu + C 0 150 + 20 \\nUsing Equation 12.2, the optimal order size is \\no* = NORMINV(CSL *, fJ.., u) = NORMINV(0.88, 350, 1 00) = 468 \\nThus it is optimal for the manager at Sportmart to order 468 pairs of skis even though \\nthe expected number of sales is 350.

The \\nexpected understock can be evaluated using Equation 12.5 as follows: \\nExpected understock = (J.L - 0)[1 - NORMDIST((O - J.L)Iu, 0, 1, 1 )] \\n+ u NORMDIST((O - J.L)/u, 0, 1, 0) \\n= (350 - 450)[1 - NORMDIST((450 - 350)/1 00, 0, 1, 1)] \\n+ 1 OONORMD/ST((450 - 350)/1 00, 0, 1, 0) = 8 \\nThus the policy of ordering 450 pairs results in an expected understock of 8 pairs. \\nNote that there is a positive expected understock and overstock in virtually every case. \\nThis result may seem counterintuitive initially, but it makes sense because the values used \\nto calculate an expected understock or overstock are always greater than or equal to zero. \\nFor example, if demand is 500 and there are 450 jackets in inventory, there is an understock \\nof 50 and an overstock of 0 (not -50). This guarantees that the expected value will be \\ngreater than or equal to zero. \\nONE-TIME ORDERS IN THE PRESENCE OF QUANTITY DISCOUNTS \\nIn this section we consider a buyer who has to make a single order when the seller \\noffers a price discount based on the quantity purchased.

In such a situation, Wal-Mart uses safety inventory to \\nincrease the level of availability and decrease the probability of stocking out between \\nsuccessive deliveries. If detergent is left over in a replenishment cycle, it can be sold in \\nthe next cycle. It does not have to be disposed of at a lower cost. However, a holding \\ncost is incurred as the product is carried from one cycle to the next. The manager at \\nWal-Mart is faced with the issue of deciding the CSL to aim for. \\nTwo extreme scenarios should be considered: \\n1. All demand that arises when the product is out of stock is backlogged and filled \\nlater, when inventories are replenished. \\n2. All demand arising when the product is out of stock is lost. \\nReality in most instances is somewhere in between, with some of the demand lost \\nand other customers returning when the product is in stock. Here we consider both \\nextreme cases. \\nWe assume that demand per unit time is normally distributed, along with the fol\\xad\\nlowing inputs: \\nQ: Replenishment lot size \\nS: Fixed cost associated with each order \\nROP: Reorder point \\nD: Average demand per unit time \\na: Standard deviation of demand per unit time \\nss: Safety inventory (recall that ss = ROP - D L) \\nCSL: Cycle service level \\nC: Unit cost \\nh: Holding cost as a fraction of product cost per unit time \\nH: Cost of holding one unit for one unit of time. H = hC \\nDemand During Stockout Is Backlogged \\nWe first consider the case in which all demand arising when the product is out of stock \\nis backlogged. Because no demand is lost, minimizing costs becomes equivalent to max\\xad\\nimizing profits. As an example, consider a Wal-Mart store selling detergent. The store \\nmanager offers a discount of Cu to each customer wanting to buy detergent when it is \\nout of stock. This ensures that all these customers return when inventory is replenished. \\nIf the store manager increases the level of safety inventory, more orders are satis\\xad\\nfied from stock, resulting in lower backlogs. This decreases the backlogging cost. \\nHowever, the cost of holding inventory increases. The store manager must pick a level \\nof safety inventory that minimizes the backlogging and holding costs. In this case, the \\noptimal cycle service level is given by \\nCSL* = 1 HQ (12.6)'),\n",

One should be careful, however, because an increase in lot size raises the \\ncycle inventory. In general, increasing the lot size is not an effective way for a firm to \\nimprove product availability. \\nIf the cost of stocking out is known, one can use Equation 12.6 to obtain the appro\\xad\\npriate cycle service level (and thus the appropriate level of safety inventory). In many \\npractical settings, it is hard to estimate the cost of stocking out. In such a situation, a \\nmanager may want to evaluate the cost of a stockout implied by the current inventory \\npolicy. When a precise cost of stockout cannot be found, this implied stockout cost at \\nleast gives an idea of whether inventory should be increased, decreased, or kept about \\nthe same. In Example 12-4 we show how Equation 12.6 can be used to impute a cost of \\nstocking out given an inventory policy. \\nExample 12-4: Imputing cost of stockout from inventory policy \\nWeekly demand for detergent at Wai-Mart is normally distributed, with \\na mean of 1-L = 1 00 gallons and a standard deviation of a = 20. The replenishment lead \\ntime is L = 2 weeks. The store manager at Wai-Mart orders 400 gallons when the available \\ninventory drops to 300 gallons. Each gallon of detergent costs $3. The holding cost \\nWai-Mart incurs is 20 percent. If all unfilled demand is backlogged and carried over to the \\nnext cycle, evaluate the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy. \\nAnalysis: In this case we have \\nLot size, Q = 400 gallons \\nReorder point, ROP = 300 gallons \\nAverage demand per week, D = 100 gallons \\nAverage demand per year, Dyear = 100 X 52 = 5,200 \\nStandard deviation of demand per week, a0 = 20 \\nUnit cost, C = $3 \\nHolding cost as a fraction of product cost per year, h = 0.2 \\nWe thus have \\nCost of holding one unit for one year, H = hC = $0.6 \\nLead time, L = 2 weeks \\nMean demand over lead time, DL = DL = 200 gallons \\nStandard deviation of demand over lead time, O\"L = aL Vf. = 20v2 = 28.3 \\nBecause demand is normally distributed, we can use Equation 11.4 to evaluate the \\nCSL under\"the current inventory policy: \\nCSL = F(ROP, DL, aL) = F(300, 200, 28.3) \\nUsing Equation 11.19 from Appendix 11 B, we obtain \\nCSL = NORMDIST(300, 200, 28.3, 1) = 0.9998 \\nWe can thus deduce that the imputed cost of stocking out (using Equation 12.6) is \\ngiven by \\nCu = HQ 0.6 X 400 \\n(1 - CSL)Dyear 0.0002 X 5,200 = $230 ·8 per gallon \\nThe implication here is that if each shortage of a gallon of detergent costs Wai-Mart \\n$230.8, the current CSL of 0.9998 is optimal. In this particular example, one can claim that \\nthe store manager is carrying too much inventory because the cost of stocking out of \\ndetergent is unlikely to be $230.8 per gallon. \\nA manager can use the aforementioned analysis to decide if the imputed cost of \\nstocking out, and thus the inventory policy, is reasonable.'),\n",

We \\nhave shown in Section 12.2 that the costs of over- and understacking have a direct \\nimpact on both the optimal cycle service level and profitability. Two obvious manager\\xad\\niallevers to increase profitability are thus \\n1. Increase the salvage value of each unit increases profitability (as well as the optimal \\ncycle service level). \\n2. Decrease the margin lost from a stockout increases profitability (as well as the \\noptimal cycle service level). \\nStrategies to increase the salvage value include selling to outlet stores so that left\\xad\\nover units are not merely discarded. Some companies, such as Sport Obermeyer, which \\nsells winter wear in the United States, sell the surplus in South America, where the win\\xad\\nter corresponds to the North American summer. The increased salvage value of the \\nsurplus allows Sport Obermeyer to provide a higher level of product availability in the \\nUnited States and increase its profits. \\nStrategies to decrease the margin lost in a stockout include arranging for backup \\nsourcing (which may be more expensive) so customers are not lost forever. The prac\\xad\\ntice of purchasing product from a competitor on the open market to satisfy customer \\ndemand is observed and justified by the earlier reasoning. In the MRO supply industry,'),\n",

Grainger, two major competitors, are also large customers \\nfor each other. The cost of understacking can also be decreased by providing the cus\\xad\\ntomer with a substitute product. \\nThe optimal cycle service level as a function of the ratio of the cost of overstocking \\nand the cost of understacking is shown in Figure 12-2. Observe that as this ratio gets \\nsmaller, the optimal level of product availability increases. This fact explains the differ\\xad\\nence in the level of product availability between a high-end store such as Nordstrom \\nand a discount store. Nordstrom has higher margins and thus a higher cost of under\\xad\\nstocking. It should thus provide a higher level of product availability than a discount \\nstore with lower margins and as a result, a lower cost of stocking out. \\nAnother significant managerial lever to improve supply chain profitability is the \\nreduction of demand uncertainty. With reduced demand uncertainty, a supply chain \\nmanager can better match supply and demand by reducing both over-and understack\\xad\\ning.

Postponement: In a multiproduct setting, postpone product differentiation until \\ncloser to the point of sale. \\n4.

The dinnerware sells only during the Christmas season, and the buyer \\nplaces an order for delivery in early November. Each dinnerware set costs c = $100 and sells \\nfor a retail price of p = $250.

The buyer has estimated \\nthat demand is normally distributed, with a mean of 1-'- = 350. Historically, forecast errors \\nhave had a standard deviation of cr = 150. The buyer has decided to conduct additional \\nmarket research to get a better forecast. Evaluate the impact of improved forecast accuracy \\non profitability and inventories as the buyer reduces cr from 150 to 0 in increments of 30. \\nAnalysis: In this case we have \\nCost of understacking = Cu = p - c = $250 - $100 = $150 \\nCost of overstocking = C 0 = c - s = $100 - $80 = $20 \\nUsing Equation 12.1, we have \\n150 \\nCSL * = Prob(Demand s 0*) 2: \\n150 + 20 \\n= 0.88 \\nThe optimal order size is obtained using Equation 12.2 and the expected profit using \\nEquation 12.3.

With a 30-week lead time, the buyer at Saks must \\norder all the store expects to sell well before the start of the sales season. It is difficult \\nfor a buyer to make an accurate forecast of demand this far in advance. This results in \\nhigh demand uncertainty, leading the buyer to order either too many or too few shawls \\neach year. If the Asian manufacturers decrease the replenishment lead time to 15 \\nweeks, the buyer at Saks must still place the entire order before the start of the sales \\nseason. However, the order can now be placed closer to the sales season, resulting in a \\nmore accurate forecast. As discussed earlier in the chapter, this reduction in uncer\\xad\\ntainty increases profits at Saks. \\nTypically, buyers are able to make very accurate forecasts once they have observed \\ndemand for the first week or two in the season. Consider the situation in which manu\\xad\\nfacturers are able to reduce replenishment lead time to six weeks. This reduction allows \\nthe buyer at Saks to break up the entire season's purchase into two orders. The first \\norder is placed six weeks before the start of the sales season. The buyer orders what the \\nstore expects to sell over the first seven weeks of the season. Once sales start, the buyer \\nobserves demand for the first week and places a second order after the first week. The \\nsecond order builds inventory up to the level that the buyer wants to order for the \\nentire season. The ability to place the second order allows the buyer to match supply \\nand demand much more effectively, resulting in higher profits. \\nWhen multiple orders are placed in the season, it is not possible to provide formu\\xad\\nlas like Equations 12.1-12.5 that specify the optimal order quantity, the expected profit, \\nexpected overstock, and expected understock. Rather, we must use simulation (see \\nAppendix 12F) to identify the impact of different ordering policies. We illustrate the \\nimpact of being able to place multiple orders using the Saks example discussed earlier. \\nThe buyer at Saks must decide on the quantity of cashmere shawls to order from \\nIndia and Nepal for the upcoming winter season.

We compare the \\nimpact of the following two ordering policies: \\n1. A single order must be placed at the beginning of the season to cover the entire \\nseason's demand. \\n2. Two orders are placed for the season, one to be delivered at the beginning of the \\nseason and the other to be delivered at the beginning of the eighth week. \\nWe consider two scenarios-one in which the buyer's forecast accuracy does not \\nimprove for the second order, and another in which it improves and the buyer is able to \\nreduce the standard deviation of the forecast to 3 instead of 15. \\nThe analysis comparing the two policies is done using a simulation. We compare \\ninventory levels as well as profitability for ordering policies in the single-and double\\xad\\norder scenarios that provide the same level of service. \\nWhen placing a single order, the ordering policy consists of a quantity to be \\nordered at the beginning of the season. \\\\Vhen placing two orders, the ordering policy \\nconsists of an initial order quantity for the first seven weeks, followed by an order\\xad\\nup-to level for the second seven weeks. The idea is that the quantity ordered in the second \\nround should account for sales during the first seven weeks and the inventory remain\\xad\\ning. If very little is sold during the first seven weeks, the second order should be small. \\nIf a lot has sold during the first seven weeks, the second order should be large.

As the manufacturer reduces replenishment lead \\ntimes, allowing for a second order, we have seen that the retailer's order size drops. In \\neffect, the manufacturer sells less to the retailer. Thus, quick response results in the \\nmanufacturer making a lower profit in the short term if all else is unchanged. This is an \\nimportant point to consider, because decreasing replenishment lead times requires \\ntremendous effort from the manufacturer, yet seems to benefit the retailer at the \\nexpense of the manufacturer. The benefits resulting from quick response should be \\nshared appropriately across the supply chain. \\nPOSTPONEMENT: IMPACT ON PROFITS AND INVENTORIES \\nAs discussed in Chapter 11, postponement refers to the delay of product differentia\\xad\\ntion until closer to the sale of the product. With postponement, all activities prior to \\nproduct differentiation require aggregate forecasts that are more accurate than indi\\xad\\nvidual product forecasts. Individual product forecasts are required close to the time of \\nsale when demand is known with greater accuracy. As a result, postponement allows a \\nsupply chain to better match supply with demand. Postponement can be a powerful \\nmanagerial lever to increase profitability. It can be particularly valuable in e-commerce \\nbecause of the lag that exists between the time customers place an order and when \\nthey expect delivery. If the supply chain can postpone product differentiation until \\nafter receiving the customer order, a significant increase in profits and reduction in \\ninventories can be achieved. \\nThe major benefit of postponement arises from the improved matching of supply \\nand demand. There is, however, a cost associated with postponement, because the pro\\xad\\nduction cost using postponement is typically higher than the production cost without it. \\nFor example, the production process at Benetton, where assembled knit garments are \\ndyed, costs about 10 percent more than if dyed thread is knitted. Similarly, when Hewlett\\xad\\nPackard postpones some assembly steps for its European printers to the European DC, \\nmanufacturing costs increase because packing, unpacking, and some other steps have to \\nbe duplicated. Given the increased production cost from postponement, a company \\nshould quantify the benefits and ensure that they are larger than the additional costs.\"),\n",

We illustrate this using the \\nBenetton example. A large fraction of Benetton's sales are from knit garments in solid \\ncolors. Starting with thread, there are two steps to completing the garment-dyeing \\nand knitting. Traditionally, thread was dyed and then the garment was knitted (Option \\n1). Benetton developed a procedure whereby dyeing was postponed until after the gar\\xad\\nment was knitted (Option 2). \\nBenetton sells each knit garment at a retail price p = $50. Option 1 results in a \\nmanufacturing cost of $20, whereas Option 2 results in a manufacturing cost of $22 per \\ngarment. Benetton disposes of any unsold garments at the end of the season in a clear\\xad\\nance for s = $10 each. The knitting or manufacturing process takes a total of 20 weeks. \\nFor the sake of discussion, we assume that Benetton sells garments in four colors. \\n'I\\\\venty weeks in advance, Benetton forecasts demand for each color to be normally \\ndistributed, with a mean of f.L = 1,000 and a standard deviation of cr = 500. Demand \\nfor each color is independent. With Option 1, Benetton makes the buying decision for \\neach color 20 weeks before the sale period and holds separate inventories for each \\ncolor. With Option 2, Benetton forecasts only the aggregate uncolored thread to pur\\xad\\nchase 20 weeks in advance. The inventory held is based on the aggregate demand \\nacross all four colors. Benetton decides the quantity for individual colors after demand \\nis known. We now quantify the impact of postponement for Benetton. \\nWith Option 1, Benetton must decide on the quantity of colored thread to pur\\xad\\nchase for each color. For each color we have \\nRetail price, p = $50 \\nManufacturing cost, c = $20 \\nSalvage value, s = $10 \\nUsing Equation 12.1, we obtain the optimal cycle service level for each color as \\n* p - c 30 \\nCSL = --= - = 0.75 \\np-s 40 \\nUsing Equation 12.2, the optimal purchase quantity of thread in each color is \\no* = NORMINV(CSL*,f.L,cr) = NORMINV(0.75,1000,500) = 1,337 \\nThus, it is optimal for Benetton to produce 1,337 units of each color. Using \\nEquation 12.3, the expected profit from each color is \\nExpected profits = $23,644 \\nUsing Equations 12.4 and 12.5, the expected over-and understock for each color is \\nExpected overstock= 412 \\nExpected understock = 75 \\nUsing Option 1, across all four colors Benetton thus produces 5,348 sweaters. This \\nresults in an expected profit of $94,576, with an average of 1,648 sweaters sold on clear\\xad\\nance at the end of the season and 300 customers turned away for lack of sweaters. \\nUnder Option 2, Benetton has to decide on the total number of sweaters across all \\nfour colors to be produced, because they can be dyed to the appropriate color once \\ndemand is known. In this case we have \\nRetail price,p = $50 \\nManufacturing cost, c = $22 \\nSalvage value, s = $10\"),\n",

The expected profit is evaluated using Equation \\n12.3 as \\nExpected profits = $98,092 \\nUsing Equation 12.4, the expected overstock is 715 and the expected understock is \\n190. Thus, postponement increases expected profits for Benetton from $94,576 to \\n$98,092. Expected overstock declines from 1,648 to 715, and the expected understock \\ndeclines from 300 to 190. Clearly, the use of postponement and production using \\nOption 2 is a good choice for Benetton in this case. \\nPostponement is not very effective if a large fraction of demand comes from a sin\\xad\\ngle product. This is because the benefit from aggregation is small in this case, whereas \\nthe increased production cost applies to all items produced. We illustrate this idea once \\nagain using Benetton as an example. \\nAssume that demand for red sweaters at Benetton is forecast to be normally dis\\xad\\ntributed, with a mean of 1-Lred = 3,100 and a standard deviation of a red = 800.

Observe that red sweaters constitute \\nabout 80 percent of demand. \\nUnder Option 1, the optimal cycle service level CSL *is 0.75, as evaluated earlier. \\nUsing Equation 12.2, the optimal production of red sweaters is given by \\no* = NORMINV(CSL*, 1-Lred• a red) = NORMINV(0.75, 3100, 800) = 3,640 \\nUsing Equation 12.3, the expected profit from red sweaters is $82,831. Using \\nEquation 12.4, the expected overstock of red sweaters is 659; using Equation 12.5, the \\nexpected understock of red sweaters is 119. For each of the other three colors, we can \\nsimilarly evaluate the optimal production to be 435 sweaters. This results in an \\nexpected profit of $6,458, an expected overstock of 165, and an expected understock of \\n30. Across all four colors, Option 1 thus results in the following: \\nTotal production = 4,945 \\nExpected profit = $102,205\"),\n",

This is \\nbecause a large fraction of demand is from red sweaters, which can already be forecast \\nwith reasonably good accuracy. Postponement and the resulting aggregation thus do \\nlittle to improve the forecasting accuracy of red sweaters. It does, however, improve the \\nforecasting accuracy for the other three colors, but they represent a small fraction of \\ndemand. Meanwhile, the production costs increase for all sweaters. As a result, the \\nincreased production costs outweigh the benefits from postponement. \\nIn tailored postponement, a firm uses production with postponement to satisfy a \\npart of its demand, with the rest being satisfied without postponement. Tailored post\\xad\\nponement produces higher profits than when no postponement is used or all products \\nare manufactured using postponement. Under tailored postponement, a firm produces \\nthe amount that is very likely to sell using the lower-cost production method without \\npostponement. The firm produces the portion of demand that is uncertain using post\\xad\\nponement. On the portion of the demand that is certain, postponement provides little \\nvalue in terms of increased forecast accuracy.

The firm is thus willing to incur \\nthe increased production cost to achieve the benefit from the improved matching of \\nsupply and demand.

The resulting profit is \\nhigher than if all units are produced entirely using Option 1 or 2. It is quite likely that \\ndemand for each color will be 800 or higher.

The remaining \\nunits are produced using Option 2 so that demand uncertainty can be reduced by \\naggregation. \\nTAILORED SOURCING: IMPACT ON PROFITS AND INVENTORIES \\nIn tail_ored sourcing, firms use a combination of two supply sources, one focusing on \\ncost but unable to handle uncertainty well, and the other focusing on flexibility to han\\xad\\ndle uncertainty, but at a higher cost. For tailored sourcing to be effective, having supply \\nsources such that one serves as the backup to the other is not sufficient. The two \\nsources must focus on different capabilities. The low-cost source must focus on being \\nefficient and should only be required to supply the predictable portion of the demand. \\nThe flexible source should focus on being responsive and be required to supply the \\nuncertain portion of the demand. As a result, tailored sourcing allows a firm to increase \\nits profits and better match supply and demand. The value of tailored sourcing depends \\non the reduction in cost that can be achieved as a result of one source facing no vari\\xad\\nability. If this benefit is small, tailored sourcing may not be ideal because of the added \\ncomplexity of implementation. Tailored sourcing may be volume based or product \\nbased, depending on the source of uncertainty. \\nIn volume-based tailored sourcing, the predictable part of a product's demand is \\nproduced at an efficient facility, whereas the uncertain portion is produced at a flexible \\nfacility. Benetton provides an example of volume-based tailored sourcing. Benetton \\n1 I\"),\n",

Benetton subcontracts production of this portion \\nwithout uncertainty to low-cost sources that have long lead times of several months. \\nFor the other 35 percent, Benetton allows retailers to place orders much closer to or \\neven after the start of the selling season. All uncertainty is concentrated in this portion \\nof the order. Benetton produces this portion of the order in a plant it owns that is very \\nflexible. Production at the Benetton plant is more expensive than production at the \\nsubcontractor's. However, the plant can produce with a lead time of weeks. A combi\\xad\\nnation of the two sources allows Benetton to reduce its inventories while incurring a \\nhigh cost of production for only a fraction of its demand. This allows it to increase \\nprofits. \\nVolume-based tailored sourcing should be considered by firms that have moved a \\nlot of their production overseas to take advantage of lower costs. The lower costs have \\nalso been accompanied by longer lead times. In such a situation, having a flexible local \\nsource with short lead times can be very effective even if the local source is more \\nexpensive. Long lead times require large safety inventories, and the resulting mismatch \\nof supply and demand hurts profits. The presence of the local source allows the firm to \\ncarry low safety inventories and supply any excess demand from the local source. The \\nmost effective combination is for the overseas source to focus on replenishing cycle \\ninventories ignoring uncertainty. The local source is used as a backup any time demand \\nexceeds the inventory available. \\nIn product-based tailored sourcing, low-volume products with uncertain demand \\nare obtained from a flexible source whereas high-volume products with less demand \\nuncertainty are obtained from an efficient source. An example of product-based tai\\xad\\nlored sourcing is Levi Strauss. Levi sells standard-sized jeans as well as jeans that can \\nbe customized to fit an individual. Standard jeans have relatively stable demimd, \\nwhereas demand for custom jeans is unpredictable. Custom jeans are produced at a \\nt1exible facility, whereas standard jeans are produced at an efficient facility. \\nIn some instances, new products have very uncertain demand while well\\xad\\nestablished products have more stable demand. Product-based tailored sourcing may \\nbe implemented with a flexible facility focusing on new products, and efficient facilities \\nfocusing on the well-established products . \\n. 4 SETTING PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR MULTIPLE \\nUNDER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS \\nIn our discussion up to this point we have assumed that a firm can set its desired level \\nof product availability and there are no constraints that interfere with this choice. A \\ncommon scenario in which this assumption fails is when the desired level of product \\navailability results in an order size that exceeds the available capacity at the supplier. \\nWhen ordering a single product, it is optimal for the buyer to order the minimum of the \\navailable capacity and the optimal order quantity. When ordering multiple products, \\nhowever, the buyer needs to consider the trade-off between ordering more of one \\nproduct versus another. \\nConsider a department store that plans to order two styles of sweaters from an \\nItalian supplier. Demand for the high-end sweater is forecast to be normally distrib\\xad\\nuted, with a mean of f.Ll = 1,000 and a standard deviation of 0'1 = 300. Demand for the \\nmid-range sweater is normally distributed, with a mean of f.L2 = 2,000 and a standard \\ndeviation of IT2 = 400. The high-end sweater has a retail price of p 1 = $150, a cost\"),\n",

The mid-range sweater has a retail price of \\np 2 = $100, a cost c1 = $40, and a salvage value of s1 = $25. Using Equation 12.1, the \\noptimal level of product availability for the high-end sweater is 0.87 and that for the \\nmid-range sweater is 0.8. Thus, without capacity constraints, it is optimal for \\nthe department store to order 1,337 units of the high-end sweater and 2,337 units of the \\nmid-range sweater. If the supplier has a capacity constraint of 3,000 units, the desired \\nordering policy is not feasible and the department store must decrease the size of its \\norder by a total of at least 674 units. Where should this decrease come from? Should \\nthe decrease be evenly divided among the two products? \\nFirst let us consider the simplistic approach of decreasing the order size of each \\nproduct by 337 units to get an order of 1,000 high-end sweaters and 2,000 mid-range \\nsweaters. This order size meets the capacity constraint and the expected profit is \\n$194,268 (using Equation 12.3). To check whether this order size is optimal, we can \\nthink in terms of how capacity is allocated to the two styles. Let us assume that we have \\ndecided to allocate 1,000 units to the high-end sweater and 1,999 units to the mid-range \\nsweater. That leaves only the last unit of capacity to be allocated. Which sweater should \\nthis unit be assigned to? It is reasonable to make this decision based on the expected \\nmarginal contribution to profits if this unit of capacity is allocated to each of the two \\nstyles. The last unit of capacity should be allocated to the sweater with the higher \\nexpected marginal contribution. Recall that Fi(Qi) is the probability that demand for \\nproduct i is Q 1 or less and let MCi(QD be the marginal contribution of a sweater of type i \\nif quantity Qi is ordered. The expected marginal contribution is evaluated similar to \\nTable 12-2 and is obtained as follows: \\nExpected marginal contribution for high-end sweater = MC 1(1,000) \\n= P1[1 - F1(1,000)] + s1 Ft(1,000)-c1 \\n= 150 X (1 - 0.5) + 35 X 0.5 - 50 = $42.50 \\nExpected marginal contribution for mid-range sweater = MC 2(1,999) \\n= p 2[1 - F2(1,999)] + s2 F2(1,999) - c2 \\n= 100 X (1 - 0.499) + 25 X 0.499 - 40 = $22.57 \\nClearly, it is better to allocate the last unit of capacity to the high-end sweater rather \\nthan the mid-range sweater. In fact, changing the order size to 1,001 high-end sweaters \\nand 1,999 mid-range sweaters increases the expected profits by almost $20. One can \\nnow decrease the order size for the mid-range sweater to 1,998 and ask how the last unit \\nof capacity should be allocated. Repeating the above procedure indicates that the order \\nsize for the high-end sweaters should be increased to at least 1,002. In fact, the order size \\nfor th-e high-end sweater should be increased until the expected marginal contribution \\nfor the high-end sweater is the same as that for the mid-range sweater. At that point it \\nno longer makes sense to move capacity from one type of sweater to another. The opti\\xad\\nmal allocation of capacity turns out to be 1,089 high-end sweaters and 1,911 mid-range \\nsweaters. The expected profits for this order size are $195,152. Observe that at optimal\\xad\\nity the high-end sweater is allocated a relatively high share of the available capacity. This \\nis because its margin relative to the cost of overstocking is higher than that of the mid\\xad\\nrange sweater. \\nThe idea of allocating the available capacity to the product with the highest \\nexpected marginal contribution can be converted into a solution procedure. Let each \\nproduct i have a mean demand of f-li and a standard deviation of u 1• Product i has a \\nretail price of Pi, a cost ci, and a salvage value of si· If quantity Qi is allocated to product \\ni, the expected marginal contribution is obtained as'),\n",

Use the analytic frameworks in this chapter to increase profits. Many firms set \\ninventory levels without any supporting analysis. Managers can provide significant \\nvalue to a firm by changing this through the use of concepts discussed in this chapter. \\nThe concepts not only provide an approach for a firm to target the optimal level of \\nproduct availability, they also help identify key managerial levers that may be used to \\nincrease profitability. \\n2. Beware of preset levels of availability. Often companies have a preset target of prod\\xad\\nuct availability without any justification. In such a situation, managers should probe the \\nrationale for the targeted level of product availability. A manager can provide sig\\xad\\nnificant value by adjusting the targeted level of product availability to one that maxi\\xad\\nmizes profits. \\n3. Use approximate costs because profit-maximizing solutions are quite robust. \\nCompanies should avoid spending an inordinate amount of effort to get exact esti\\xad\\nmates of various costs used to evaluate optimal levels of product availability. Levels of \\nproduct availability close to optimal will often produce a profit that is very close to the \\noptimal profit. Thus, it is not crucial that all costs be estimated precisely. A reasonable \\napproximation of the costs will generally produce targeted levels of product availabil\\xad\\nity that are close to optimal. \\n4. Estimate a range for the cost of stocking out. Firms' efforts to set levels of product \\navailability often get bogged down in debate over the cost of stocking out. The some\\xad\\ntimes controversial nature of this cost and its hard-to-quantify components (such as \\nloss of customer goodwill) make it a difficult number for people from different func\\xad\\ntions to agree on. However, it is often not necessary to estimate a precise cost of stock\\xad\\ning out. Using a range of the cost of stocking out, a manager can identify appropriate \\nlevels of availability and the associated profits. Often, profits do not change signifi\\xad\\ncantly in the range, thus eliminating the need for a more precise estimation of the cost \\nof stocking out. \\n5. Ensure levels of product availability fit with strategy. A manager should use the level \\nof product availability suggested by the analysis along with the firm's strategic objectives \\nwhen setting the targeted level of product availability. In some instances, a firm may find it \\nappropriate to provide a high level of product availability for a low-volume item that is \\nnot very profitable but is required by important customers. A firm trying to project a rep\\xad\\nutation for product availability may find it appropriate to provide a high level of availabil\\xad\\nity for all products, even if the margins of each individual product do not justify it. \\n12.6 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Identify the factors affecting the optimal level of product availability and evaluate the opti\\xad\\nmal cycle service level. \\nThe cost of overstocking by one unit and the lost current and future margin from \\nunderstacking by one unit are the two major factors that affect the optimal level of product \\navailability. The optimal level of availability is obtained by balancing the costs of over-and \\nunderstacking. As the cost of overstocking increases, it is optimal to lower the targeted level \\nof product availability. As the lost margin from being out of stock increases, it is optimal to \\nraise the targeted level of product availability.\"),\n",

Green Thumb, a manufacturer of lawn care equipment, has introduced a new product. Each \\nunit costs $150 to manufacture, and the introductory price is to be $200. At this price, the \\nanticipated demand is normally distributed, with a mean of f.l. = 100 and a standard devia\\xad\\ntion of cr = 40. Any unsold units at the end of the season are unlikely to be very valuable \\nand will be disposed of in a fire sale for $50 each. It costs $20 to hold a unit in inventory for \\nthe entire season. How many units should Green Thumb manufacture for sale? What is the \\nexpected profit from this policy? On average, how many customers does Green Thumb \\nexpect to turn away because of stocking out? \\n2. The general manager at Green Thumb decides to conduct extensive market research for its \\nnew product. At the end of the market research, the manager estimates demand to be nor\\xad\\nmally distributed, with a mean of f.l. = 100 and a standard deviation of cr = 15. How should \\nGreen Thumb alter its production plans in Exercise 1 as a result of the market research? \\nHow much increase in profit is it likely to observe? How does the improved forecast affect \\nthe demand lost by Green Thumb because of understacking? Use cost and price information \\nfrom Exercise 1. \\n3.

Lake Grove Confectionaries (LGC) sells chocolates for the holiday season in specially \\ndesigned boxes. The firm sells four different designs, and currently all packaging is done in \\nthe plant as chocolates are manufactured. All manufacturing and packaging for the holiday \\nseason is completed before the start of the season. The demand forecast for each of the four \\ndesigns is normal, with a mean of 20,000 and a standard deviation of 8,000. Each box costs \\n$10 and is sold for $20.

Chocolates will be produced before the start of the season, but packaging will \\nbe done on an express line as orders come in. The express line and separation of \\nsteps adds $2 to the cost of production. How many boxes of chocolates should LGC \\nmanufacture if it decides to postpone packaging? What is the expected profit? How \\nmany boxes will LGC sell at a discount if it uses postponement? \\n(e) At what additional cost of postponement (instead of the current $2) would LGC be \\nindifferent between operating with and without postponement? \\n13.

Currently all \\nsweaters are produced before the start of the season. Production cost is $20 per sweater, and \\nthey are sold for a wholesale price of $35. Any unsold sweaters at the end of the season are \\ndiscounted to $15, and they all sell at that price.

In some instances, future scenarios can \\nbe modeled mathematically without simulation and for\\xad\\nmulas can be obtained for the impact of different policies \\non performance. In other cases, formulas are difficult or \\nimpossible to obtain and one must use simulation. \\nSimulations are powerful because they can accommodate \\nany number of complications. Problems that are impossi\\xad\\nble to solve analytically can often be solved fairly easily \\nwith simulation. A good simulation is an inexpensive way \\nto test different actions and identify the most effective \\ndecision given an uncertain future. \\nConsider Lands' End, a mail-order firm that sells \\napparel. Lands' End faces uncertain demand and has to \\nmake decisions regarding the number of catalogs to print \\nand mail, the number of units of each product to order, and \\nthe contracts to enter into with its suppliers. The general \\nmanager at Lands' End wants to evaluate different policies \\nbefore implementing them. A simulation requires the \\nmanager to create a computer model that mimics the \\norders placed, inventory held, customer demand, and other \\nprocesses that are part of the Lands' End supply chain. \\nAn instance of demand refers to random demand \\nobtained from a demand distribution. Each time demand \\nis generated from a distribution, a new instance results. \\nBased on estimates of the future demand distribution, \\ninstances of demand for different products are generated \\nrandomly. The impact of an ordering policy is evaluated \\nfor each instance of demand generated. Based on a large \\nnumber of demand instances, the manager can evaluate \\nthe mean and variability of the performance of a policy. \\nDifferent policies can then be compared. \\nGenerating Random Numbers Using Excel A fundamen\\xad\\ntal step in any simulation is the generation of random \\nnumbers that correspond to the distribution that has been \\nestimated for future demand or some other parameter. \\nFor example, if Lands' End has estimated demand for \\ncashmere sweaters from the winter catalog to be normally \\ndistributed, with a mean of 3,000 and a standard deviation \\nof 1,000, the manager needs to generate several instances \\nof demand from this distribution. There are several func\\xad\\ntions available in Excel that generate random numbers. \\nThe RAND( ) function generates a random number \\nthat is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. There is \\nthus a 10 percent probability that RAND() will generate \\na number between 0 and 0.1, a 50 percent probability that \\nit will generate a random number between 0 and 0.5, and \\na 90 percent probability that it will generate a random \\nnumber between 0 and 0.9. The RAND() function can be \\nused to generate random numbers from a variety of \\ndistributions. \\nThe Excel function NORMINV(RAND( ), J.L, a) \\ngenerates a random number that is normally distributed, \\nwith mean J.L and standard deviation a. The Excel func\\xad\\ntion NORMSINV(RAND( )) generates a random num\\xad\\nber that is normally distributed, with a mean of 0 \\nand standard deviation of 1. The fact that both \\nNORMINV and NORMS/NV can generate negative \\nnumbers often poses problems when they are used to \\ngenerate demand. One option is to use a maximum of 0 \\nand NORMINV(RAND( ), J.L, a) to generate demand. \\nThis is appropriate if the coefficient of variation, cv, is \\nless than 0.4. For larger coefficients of variation it is better \\nto use the log-normal distribution because it generates \\nonly nonnegative numbers. The Excel function \\nLOGINV(RAND( ), J.L, a) generates a random number X \\nthat follows the log-normal distribution, where ln(X) is \\nnormally distributed, with mean J.L and standard deviation \\na. Several other demand distributions may also be gener\\xad\\nated, using other Excel functions. \\nSetting Up a Simulation Model Lands' End plans to sell \\ncashmere sweaters in its winter catalog for $150 each. The \\nmanager expects demand to be normally distributed, with \\na mean of J.L = 3,000 and a standard deviation of \\na = 1,000. Toward the end of the winter season, Lands' \\nEnd sends out a sales catalog with discounted prices on \\nunsold items. The discounted price determines the \\ndemand in response to the sales catalog. The manager \\nanticipates that the sales catalog will generate demand \\nfor cashmere sweaters with a mean of 1,000 - 5p and a \\nstandard deviation of (1,000 - 5p )/3, where p is the dis\\xad\\ncounted price charged. Any leftover sweaters after the \\nsales catalog are donated to charity. Each sweater costs \\nLands' End $50. Thus, the donation to charity fetches $25 \\nin tax benefits. Lands' End incurs a cost of $5 per unsold \\nsweater to store and transport them to charity, resulting \\nin a salvage value of s = $20 per sweaters sent to charity. \\nThe manager has decided to charge a discount price of \\nmax($25, $150 - n/20), where n is the number of \\nsweaters left over after the winter catalog. The manager \\nwants to identify the number of sweaters that should be \\npurchased at the start of the winter season. \\nThe first step is to set up a simulation model that \\nevaluates the net profit for an instance of demand during \\nthe winter season.

Transportation is \\nan important supply chain driver because products are rarely produced and consumed \\nin the same l9cation. Transportation is a significant component of the costs incurred by \\nmost supply chains. In fact, transportation activity represented more than 10 percent of \\nthe GDP of the United States in 2002.1 Only three sectors-housing, health care, and \\nfood-contributed a larger share to GDP than transportation. Transportation-related \\njobs employed nearly 20 million people in 2002, accounting for 16 percent of U.S. total \\noccupational employment. \\nThe role of transportation is even more significant in global supply chains. Dell \\ncurrently has suppliers worldwide and sells to customers all over the world from just a \\nfew plants. Transportation allows products to move across Dell's global network. \\nSimilarly, global transportation allows Wal-Mart to sell products manufactured all over \\nthe world in the United States. \\nInternational trade is becoming a bigger part of the world's economic activity. \\nAccording to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, total international merchandise \\n1 Freight Shipments in America, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2002. \\n--------~----- -------------~---~----\\n- ------\"),\n",

Between 1970 \\nand 2001, U.S. international merchandise trade grew by over 20 times, whereas the U.S. \\neconomy grew about 10 times over the same period. With the rapid growth in interna\\xad\\ntional trade, good multimodal freight transportation systems to move the resulting \\ncargo have become even more significant. \\nAny supply chain's success is closely linked to the appropriate use of transporta\\xad\\ntion. IKEA, the Scandinavian home furnishings retailer, has built a global network \\nwith about 180 stores in 23 countries primarily on the basis of effective transportation. \\nIKEA's sales for the year ending August 2004 reached 12.8 billion euros. IKEA's strat\\xad\\negy is built around providing good-quality products at low prices. Their goal is to cut \\nprices by 2 to 3 percent each year. As a result, IKEA works hard to find the most inex\\xad\\npensive global source for each of its products. Modular design of its furniture allows \\nIKEA to transport its goods worldwide much more cost effectively than a traditional \\nfurniture manufacturer. The large size of IKEA stores and shipments allows inex\\xad\\npensive transportation of home furnishings all the way to the retail store. Effective \\nsourcing and inexpensive transportation allow IKEA to provide high-quality home \\nfurnishings at low prices globally. \\nSeven-Eleven Japan is another firm that has used transportation to achieve its \\nstrategic goals. The company has a goal of carrying products in its stores to match the \\nneeds of customers as they vary by geographic location or time of day. To help achieve \\nthis goal, Seven-Eleven Japan uses a very responsive transportation system that \\nreplenishes its stores several times a day so that the products available match cus\\xad\\ntomers' needs. Products from different suppliers are aggregated on trucks according to \\nthe required temperature to help achieve very frequent deliveries at a reasonable cost. \\nSeven-Eleven Japan uses a responsive transportation system along with aggregation to \\ndecrease its transportation and receiving costs while ensuring that product availability \\nclosely matches customer demand. \\nSupply chains also use responsive transportation to centralize inventories and \\noperate with fewer facilities. For example, Amazon.com relies on package carriers and \\nthe postal system to deliver customer orders from centralized warehouses. Dell manu\\xad\\nfactures in a few locations in the United States and uses responsive transportation pro\\xad\\nvided by package carriers to provide customers with highly customized products at a \\nreasonable price. \\nThe shipper is the party that requires the movement of the product between two \\npoints in the supply chain. The carrier is the party that moves or transports the product. \\nFor example, when Dell uses UPS to ship its computers from the factory to the cus\\xad\\ntomer, Dell is the shipper and UPS is the carrier. Two other parties have a significant \\nimpact on transportation: the owners and operators of transportation infrastructure \\nsuch as roads, ports, canals, and airports; and the bodies that set transportation policy \\nworldwide. Actions by all four parties influence the effectiveness of transportation. \\nTo understand transportation in a supply chain it is important to consider the per\\xad\\nspective of all four parties. A carrier makes investment decisions regarding the \\ntransportation equipment (locomotives, trucks, airplanes, etc.) and in some cases \\ninfrastructure (rail), and then makes operating decisions to try to maximize the return \\nfrom these assets. A shipper, in contrast, uses transportation to minimize the total cost \\n(transportation, inventory, information, sourcing, and facility) while providing an \\nappropriate level of responsiveness to the customer. \\n2 US.

The carrier's primary objective is to ensure good utilization of its \\nassets while providing customers with an acceptable level of service. Carrier decisions \\nare affected by equipment cost, fixed operating cost, variable operating costs, the \\nresponsiveness the carrier seeks to provide its target segment, and the prices that the \\nmarket will bear. For example, FedEx designed a hub-and-spoke airline network for \\ntransporting packages to provide fast, reliable delivery times. UPS, in contrast, uses a \\ncombination of aircrafts, rail, and trucks to provide cheaper transportation with some\\xad\\nwhat longer delivery times. The difference between the two transportation networks is \\nreflected in the pricing schedule. FedEx charges for packages based primarily on size. \\nUPS, in contrast, charges based on both size and destination. From a supply chain per\\xad\\nspective, a hub-and-spoke air network is more appropriate when prices are independent \\nof destination and rapid delivery is important, whereas a trucking network is more appro\\xad\\npriate when prices vary with destination and a somewhat slower delivery is acceptable. \\nAIR \\nMajor airlines in the United States that carry both passenger and cargo include \\nAmerican, United, and Delta. Airlines have a high fixed cost in infrastructure and \\nequipment. Labor and fuel costs are largely trip related and independent of the num\\xad\\nber of passengers or amount of cargo carried on a flight. An airline's goal is to maxi\\xad\\nmize the daily flying time of a plane and the revenue generated per trip. Given the large \\nfixed costs and relatively low variable costs, revenue management (see Chapter 15), \\nin which airlines vary seat prices and allocate seats to different price classes, is a signifi\\xad\\ncant factor in the success of passenger airlines. At present, airlines practice revenue \\nmanagement for passengers but much less so for cargo. \\nAir carriers offer a very fast and fairly expensive mode of transportation. Small, \\nhigh-value items or time-sensitive emergency shipments that have to travel a long dis\\xad\\ntance are best suited for air transport. Air carriers normally move shipments under 500 \\npounds, including high-value but lightweight high-tech products. Given the growth in high \\ntechnology, the weight of freight carried by air has diminished over the last two decades \\neven as the value of the freight has increased somewhat. In 2002, the goods U.S. busi\\xad\\nnesses moved by air were valued at $75,000 per ton, by far the highest among all modes. \\nThe value of international trade moved by air to and from the United States grew \\nsignificantly, from $10 billion in 1970 to $519 billion in 2001, growing at an average \\nannual rate of 14 percent per year.3 Between 1980 and 2001, freight operating revenues \\nfor u:s. international cargo increased from $1 billion to over $6 billion. Since 2001, \\nhowever, the challenge of cargo security and the growing cost of fuel have had a signif\\xad\\nicant impact on the financial performance of air carriers. The impact was exacerbated \\nby the significant capacity the industry added by acquiring new aircraft. \\nKey issues that air carriers face include identifying the location and number of \\nhubs, assigning planes to routes, setting up maintenance schedules for planes, schedul\\xad\\ning crews, and managing prices and availability at different prices. \\nPACKAGE CARRIERS \\nPackage carriers are transportation companies such as FedEx, UPS, and the U.S. Postal \\nService, which carry small packages ranging from letters to shipments weighing about \\n150 pounds.

Package carriers are expensive and cannot compete with LTL carriers on \\nprice for large shipments. The major service they offer shippers is rapid and reliable \\ndelivery. Thus, shippers use package carriers for small and time-sensitive shipments. \\nPackage carriers also provide other value-added services that allow shippers to speed \\ninventory flow and track order status. By tracking order status, shippers can proactively \\ninform customers about their packages. Package carriers also pick up the package from \\nthe source and deliver it to the destination site. With an increase in just-in-time (JIT) \\ndeliveries and focus on inventory reduction, demand for package carriers has grown. \\nPackage carriers are the preferred mode of transport for e-businesses such as \\nAmazon.com and Dell, as well as for companies such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster\\xad\\nCarr that send small packages to customers. With the growth in e-business, the use of \\npackage carriers has increased significantly over the last few years. Package carriers \\nseek out smaller and more time-sensitive shipments than air cargo, especially where \\ntracking and other value-added services are important to the shipper. FedEx uses \\ntrucks to pick up packages at the source and deliver them to the final destination. Air \\ncargo carriers do not provide this combined service. Companies use air cargo carriers \\nfor larger shipments and package carriers for smaller, more time-sensitive ones. For \\nexample, Dell uses air cargo to bring components from Asia but uses package carriers \\nto deliver PCs to customers. \\nGiven the small size of packages and several delivery points, consolidation of ship\\xad\\nments is a key factor in increasing utilization and decreasing costs for package carriers. \\nPackage carriers have trucks that make local deliveries and pick up packages. Packages \\nare then taken to large sorting centers from which they are sent by full truckload, rail, \\nor air to the sorting center closest to the delivery point. From the delivery-point sorting \\ncenter, the package is sent to customers on small trucks making milk runs (discussed \\nlater in the chapter). Key issues in this industry include the location and capacity of \\ntransfer points as well as information capability to facilitate and track package flow. \\nFor the final delivery to a customer, an important consideration is the scheduling and \\nrouting of the delivery trucks. \\nTRUCK \\nIn 2002, trucks moved 64 percent of U.S commercial freight by value and 58 percent by \\nweight.4 The trucking industry consists of two major segments-TL or LTL. Trucking is \\nmore expensive than rail but offers the advantage of door-to-door shipment and a \\nshorter delivery time. It also has the advantage of requiring no transfer between \\npickup and-delivery. Major TL carriers include Schneider National, JB Hunt, Ryder \\nIntegrated, Werner, and Swift Transportation. \\nTL operations have relatively low fixed costs, and owning a few trucks is often suf\\xad\\nficient to enter the business. As a result there are many TL carriers in the industry. \\nSchneider National, the largest TL carrier, had only 17 percent of the market share \\namong the top 40 firms in the United States in 1996. The goal of a TL carrier is to \\nschedule shipments to meet service requirements while minimizing both trucks' idle \\nand empty travel time. \\nTL pricing displays economies of scale withrespect to the distance traveled. Given \\ntrailers of different size, pricing also displays economies of scale with respect to the size \\nof the trailer used. TL shipping is suited for transportation between manufacturing \\nfacilities and warehouses or between suppliers and manufacturers. For example, \\nProctor & Gamble offers TL shipping to customer warehouses. \\n4Freight Shipments in America, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2002.\"),\n",

Prices display some \\neconomies of scale with the quantity shipped as well as the distance traveled. LTL ship\\xad\\nments take longer than TL shipments because of other loads that need to be picked up \\nand dropped off. LTL shipping is suited for shipments that are too large to be mailed as \\nsmall packages but that constitute less than half a TL. \\nA key to reducing LTL costs is the degree of consolidation that carriers can achieve \\nfor the loads carried. LTL carriers use consolidation centers to which trucks bring in many \\nsmall loads originating from a geographic area and leave with many small loads destined \\nfor the same geographic area. This allows LTL carriers to improve their truck use, \\nalthough it increases delivery time somewhat. Larger firms enjoy an advantage in the LTL \\nindustry given the importance of consolidation and the fixed cost of setting up consolida\\xad\\ntion centers. Strong regional players have developed in the LTL industry because of the \\nadvantage offered by a high density of pickup and delivery points in a geographic area. \\nKey issues for the LTL industry include location of consolidation centers, assigning \\nof loads to trucks, and scheduling and routing of pickup and delivery. The goal is to \\nminimize costs through consolidation without hurting delivery time and reliability. \\nRAIL \\nIn 2002, rail carried about 4 percent of U.S. shipments by value, 12 percent by weight, \\nand over 25 percent of total ton-miles. These figures reflect the use of rail to move \\ncommodities over large distances. Rail carriers incur a high fixed cost in terms of rails, \\nlocomotives, cars, and yards. There is also a significant trip-related labor and fuel cost \\nthat is independent of the number of cars (fuel costs do vary somewhat with the num\\xad\\nber of cars) but does vary with the distance traveled and the time taken. Any idle time, \\nonce a train is powered, is very expensive because labor and fuel costs are incurred \\neven though trains are not moving. Idle time occurs when trains exchange cars for dif\\xad\\nferent destinations. It also occurs because of track congestion. Labor and fuel together \\naccount for over 60 percent of railroad expense. From an operational perspective, it is \\nthus important for railroads to keep locomotives and crew well utilized. \\nThe price structure and the heavy load capability makes rail an ideal mode for car\\xad\\nrying large, heavy, or high-density products over long distances. Transportation time by \\nrail, however, can be long. Rail is thus ideal for very heavy, low-value shipments that are \\nnot very time sensitive. Coal, for example, is a major part of each railroad\\'s shipments. \\nSmall, time-sensitive, short-distance or short-lead-time shipments rarely go by rail. \\nA major goal for railroad firms is to keep locomotives and crews well utilized. \\nMajor operational issues at railroads include vehicle and staff scheduling, track and \\nterminal delays, and poor on-time performance. Railroad performance is hurt by the \\nlarge amount of time taken at each transition. The travel time is usually a small fraction \\nof the total time for a rail shipment. Delays get exaggerated because trains today are \\ntypically not scheduled but \"built.\" In other words, a train leaves once there are enough \\ncars to constitute the train. Cars wait for the train to build, adding to the uncertainty of \\nthe delivery time for a shipper. A railroad can improve on-time performance by sched\\xad\\nuling some of the trains instead of building all of them.

Within the United States, water transport takes place via the inland waterway \\nsystem (the Great Lakes and rivers) or coastal waters. Water transport is ideally suited \\nfor carrying very large loads at low cost. Within the United States, water transport is \\nused primarily for the movement of large bulk commodity shipments and is the cheap\\xad\\nest mode for carrying such loads. It is, however, the slowest of all the modes, and signif\\xad\\nicant delays occur at ports and terminals. This makes water transport difficult to oper\\xad\\nate for short-haul trips, though it is used effectively in Japan and parts of Europe for \\ndaily short-haul trips of a few miles. \\nWithin the United States, the passage of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 \\nhas been a significant event for water transport. This act allows carriers and shippers to \\nenter into confidential contracts, effectively deregulating the industry. The act is similar \\nto the deregulation that occurred in the trucking and airline industries over two \\ndecades ago and is likely to have a similar impact on the shipping industry. \\nIn global trade, water transport is the dominant mode for shipping all kinds of \\nproducts. Cars, grain, apparel, and other products are shipped by sea. In 2001, mer\\xad\\nchandise trade valued at over $718 billion moved between the United States and \\nforeign seaports. Maritime transportation accounted for 78 percent of the U.S. inter\\xad\\nnational merchandise freight by weight in 2002. For the quantities shipped and the \\ndistances involved in international trade, water transport is by far the cheapest mode of \\ntransport. A significant trend in maritime trade worldwide has been the growth in con\\xad\\ntainerization. This has led to a demand for larger, faster, and more specialized vessels to \\nimprove the economics of container transport. Delays at ports, customs, security, and the \\nmanagement of containers used are major issues in global shipping. Port congestion in \\nparticular has been a big problem in the United States. \\nPIPELINE \\nPipeline is used primarily for the transport of crude petroleum, refined petroleum \\nproducts, and natural gas. In the United States, pipeline accounted for about 17 percent \\nof total ton-miles in 2002. A significant initial fixed cost is incurred in setting up the \\npipeline and related infrastructure that does not vary significantly with the diameter of \\nthe pipeline. Pipeline operations are typically optimized at about 80 to 90 percent of \\npipeline capacity. Given the nature of the costs, pipelines are best suited when rela\\xad\\ntively stable and large flows are required. Pipeline may be an effective way of getting \\ncrude oil to a port or a refinery. Sending gasoline to a gas station does not justify invest\\xad\\nment in a pipeline and is done better with a truck. Pipeline pricing usually consists of \\ntwo compon~nts-a fixed component related to the shipper's peak usage and a second \\ncharge relating to the actual quantity transported. This pricing structure encourages \\nthe shipper to use the pipeline for the predictable component of demand with other \\nmodes often being used to cover fluctuations. \\nINTERMODAL \\nIntermodal transportation is the use of more than one mode of transport to move a \\nshipment to its destination. A variety of intermodal combinations are possible, with the \\nmost common being truck/rail. Major intermodal providers with rail include CSX \\nIntermodal, Pacer Stacktrain, and Triple Crown. Intermodal traffic has grown consid\\xad\\nerably with the increased use of containers for shipping and the rise of global trade. \\nContainers are easy to transfer from one mode to another, and their use facilitates \\nintermodal transportation. Containerized freight often uses truck/water/rail combina\\xad\\ntions, particularly for global freight. For global trade, intermodal is often the only \\noption because factories and markets may not be next to ports. As the quantity shipped\"),\n",

In 1996, intermodal activity contributed 16 percent of rail revenues.5 On land, \\nthe rail/truck intermodal system offers the benefit of lower cost than TL and delivery \\ntimes that are better than rail, thereby bringing together different modes of transport \\nto create a price/service offering that cannot be matched by any single mode. It also \\ncreates convenience for shippers who now deal with only one entity representing all \\ncarriers who together provide the intermodal service. \\nKey issues in the intermodal industry involve the exchange of information to facil\\xad\\nitate shipment transfers between different modes because these transfers often involve \\nconsiderable delays, hurting delivery time performance. \\n13.3 TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND POLICIES \\nRoads, seaports, airports, rail, and canals are some of the major infrastructural ele\\xad\\nments that exist along nodes and links of a transportation network. In almost all coun\\xad\\ntries, the government has either taken full responsibility or played a significant role in \\nbuilding and managing these infrastructure elements. Even in the United States, where \\na lot of the rail infrastructure was built by private capital under a charter, the cost was \\nsubsidized through land grants from the government. Improved infrastructure has \\nplayed a significant role in the development of transportation and the resulting growth \\nof trade. The role of the railroads and canals in the economic development of the \\nUnited States is well documented. More recently, the impact of improved road, air, and \\nport infrastructure on the development of China is very visible. \\nBefore considering policy questions related to transportation infrastructures, it is \\nworth looking at the history of rail and road infrastructure in the United States to see \\nsome of the issues involved. We summarize some of the discussion by Ellison (2002) of \\nthe history of railroads and regulation in the industry. The construction of railroads in \\nthe United States occurred rapidly during the 1850s. The railroads were private but \\nwere built with significant government subsidy, often in the form of land grants. By the \\n1870s, the railroad network connected most of the United States. Each railroad was the \\nexclusive provider of carriage over its track. This monopoly allowed railroads to deter\\xad\\nmine the price they charged as well as the level of service they provided their cus\\xad\\ntomers. Initial construction of new railroads led to some competition over rates. The \\nrailroad companies responded by entering into agreements with each other that effec\\xad\\ntively ended competition and raised rates. Protests by farmers and other users of the \\nrailroads led eventually to the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission \\n(ICC), which prohibited discriminatory pricing. The ICC required railroads to file their \\nrates with the ICC and made them public. The railroads responded by forming cartels \\nto restrict supply. This led to the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. \\nResponding to the financial difficulties of railways in the 1940s, the government \\nallowed them some degree of coordination and exempted them from the antitrust reg\\xad\\nulations. With the growth of other modes of transport and the need to revitalize their \\nassets, the railroads were in bad financial shape in the early 1970s. The Staggers Rail \\nAct of 1980 deregulated the railroads, allowed them some rate-making powers, and \\neased entry and exit. The act also removed the antitrust immunity of the railroads. \\nDeregulation in the United States was followed by a wave of reorganization and merg\\xad\\ners within the railroad industry. Overall, deregulation has resulted in improved finan\\xad\\ncial performance of the railroad industry and increased use of rail by shippers. \\n5Distribution, July 1997. \\n-----------~---------~--\\n-.'),\n",

In the late 1700s, turnpikes were built using public funds in Virginia, \\nMaryland, and Pennsylvania but were then turned over to private companies that col\\xad\\nlected tolls. Over time, other turnpikes were built as a result of competition between \\ntowns to gain trade. Other than federal land grants, these roads were typically built \\nwith local effort and money. The tolls on these turnpikes were generally structured to \\nkeep local travel free and make people traveling across an area pay for this right. With \\nthe growth in railroads and canals, turnpikes suffered financially in the mid-1800s and \\nwere eventually converted into public roads. In the twentieth century, as the modes of \\ntransport changed, there was a need for higher-quality roads. A network of national \\ntoll-free highways was built, largely using gasoline taxes as the source of funding. At \\nthe same time, other facilities such as tunnels and bridges were often constructed as toll \\nfacilities. In many other countries, such as France and Spain, concessions were granted \\nto private companies that received toll revenue. More recently, private toll roads have \\nalso been built in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. \\nFrom the above examples it seems reasonable that the government has to either \\nown or regulate a monopolistic transportation infrastructure asset. When the trans\\xad\\nportation infrastructure asset has competition either within a mode or across modes, \\nprivate ownership, deregulation, and competition seem to work well. The deregulation \\nof the transportation industry within the United States is a case in point. Keep in mind, \\nhowever, that roads, ports, and airports are largely public and not private. This is \\nbecause of the inherently monopolistic nature of these transportation infrastructure \\nassets. In such a setting the public ownership of these assets is justified. This raises the \\npolicy question of financing the construction and maintenance of these publicly owned \\ntransportation assets. Should roads be financed through a gasoline tax, or is some other \\nform of financing such as tolls more appropriate? \\nEconomists such as Vickrey have argued for public ownership of these assets but \\nthe setting of quasi-market prices to improve overall efficiency. Quasi-market prices \\nneed to take into account the discrepancy between the incentives of an individual using \\nthe transportation infrastructure and the public as a whole that owns the infrastruc\\xad\\nture. This discrepancy is illustrated in Figure 13-1 in the context of road traffic. \\nPrice of \\nTrip Marginal Cost of \\nTime + Operation \\nAverage Cost of Time+ \\nOperation \\nDemand Curve \\nVehicle Flow Rate'),\n",

Figure 13-1 assumes that different people have different value for making the trip and \\nthis value is uniformly distributed over an interval. The number of users whose value \\nfrom a trip exceeds a particular cost is thus defined by the demand curve. The costs \\nincurred by a motorist include the cost of time spent on the highway and the cost of \\noperating and maintaining the vehicle. It is well known that the time spent increases \\nnonlinearly with congestion on a highway. Thus, the average cost to each motorist \\nincreases with traffic flow as shown in Figure 13-1. Given people\\'s valuation of the trip, \\nthe number of motorists using the road is determined by the intersection of the \\ndemand curve with the average cost curve at point A. This results in an average cost to \\nmotorists of Po and a traffic flow of Q 0. From the perspective of the public, however, it \\nis more appropriate to consider how each additional motorist impacts the total cost. \\nObserve that an additional motorist increases the average cost by a small amount but \\nincreases the total cost across all motorists by a much larger amount. This is repre\\xad\\nsented in Figure 13-1 by the marginal cost curve, which measures the marginal increase \\nin total cost as a result of additional traffic flow. Observe that the marginal cost curve is \\nhigher than the average cost curve. In other words, the marginal impact of a motorist \\non total cost is much higher than his or her share of the impact. From a marginal cost \\nperspective, motorists should be charged a toll P1 - Po so that the cost they bear is the \\ntrue cost they are imposing on the highway system. This toll lowers the vehicle flow \\nrate to Q 1. In other words, the absence of a congestion toll results in an overuse of the \\ntransportation infrastructure and a resulting congestion cost on all users. The problem \\nis well illustrated by a simple illustration given by Vickrey (see Button and Verhoef, \\n1998). Each member of a group going out to dinner is likely to order an expensive item \\nif the plan is to share the bill equally at the end instead of having each person pay his \\nor her true charge. Thus, it is fair to say that the overall bill is higher if it is shared \\nequally compared to each person paying based on actual consumption. The same is \\ntrue with transportation infrastructure if pricing is not linked to congestion. \\nQuasi-market prices for transportation infrastructure thus result in higher prices \\nat peak locations and times and lower prices otherwise. Such pricing is not commonly \\nobserved for transportation infrastructure except for roads in Singapore and city cen\\xad\\nters in a few European cities. Congestion is a major factor at several ports and airports. \\nThe Los Angeles-Long Beach port, for example, experienced significant congestion in \\n2004. Several factors affected the congestion, including capacity problems on railroads \\ntaking containers away, labor shortages, and technology issues. However, congestion was \\nalso affected by the desire of many shippers to bring weekly shipments from Asia over \\nthe weekend to ensure supply for the entire week. This created a peak time with signifi\\xad\\ncant congestion. The peak workload also becomes exaggerated as container ships get \\nlarger. In such a situation, the use of peak tolls to level out the arrivals can be an effective \\npolicy. Overall, it is important to keep in mind that transportation infrastructure faces \\ncongestion-related problems unless users are forced to internalize the marginal impact \\non society of their actions. It may be most effective to charge a congestion toll and use \\nthe money generated to improve the effectiveness of the transportation infrastructure. \\n-,-; -;.-\">·\\'\"; ,--~-:\\'>_~< -,·,_- \\' ---, ,- )-::.;::::-;.:_~:~-,/ --?;c·.-,i~-\\';;\"·\\'·1\\'-\"J.\"< \\n,~~\"ill9•~1\"}\\'-rr?n~§\\'Q~?~i~f1;1~fE~~~~~q~~~~~,~~~n2r~~cli!ec~~y~~r1~,~~fb~\\'~~~~~Ip:or \\n:.~~~~{~~~!~i~t~lf!~\\\\~{fl:e;j~f~~iY~~ \\n.. · ..

A well-designed transportation network \\nallows a supply chain to achieve the desired degree of responsiveness at a low cost. We \\ndiscuss a variety of design options for transportation networks and the strengths and \\nweaknesses for each option in the context of a buyer with multiple locations sourcing \\nfrom several suppliers. These design options may be implemented between any two \\nstages of a supply chain. \\nDIRECT SHIPMENT NETWORK \\nWith the direct shipment network option, the buyer structures his transportation net\\xad\\nwork so that all shipments come directly from each supplier to each buyer location, as \\nshown in Figure 13-2. With a direct shipment network, the routing of each shipment is \\nspecified and the supply chain manager only needs to decide on the quantity to ship \\nand the mode of transportation to use. This decision involves a trade-off between \\ntransportation and inventory costs, as discussed later in the chapter. \\nThe major advantage of a direct shipment transportation network is the elimina\\xad\\ntion of intermediate warehouses and its simplicity of operation and coordination. The \\nshipment decision is completely local, and the decision made for one shipment does \\nnot influence others. The transportation time from supplier to buyer location is short \\nbecause each shipment goes direct. \\nA direct shipment network is justified if demand at buyer locations is large enough \\nthat optimal replenishment lot sizes are close to a TL from each supplier to each loca\\xad\\ntion. With small buyer locations, however, a direct shipment network tends to have \\nhigh costs. If a TL carrier is used for transportation, the high fixed cost of each truck \\nresults in large lots moving from suppliers to each buyer location, resulting in high sup\\xad\\nply chain inventories. If a LTL carrier is used, the transportation cost and the delivery \\ntime increase, though inventories are lower. If package carriers are used, transporta\\xad\\ntion costs are very high. With direct deliveries from each supplier, receiving costs are \\nhigh because each supplier must make a separate delivery. \\nSuppliers Buyer Locations'),\n",

In direct shipping with milk runs, a supplier delivers directly to multiple \\nbuyer locations on a truck or a truck picks up deliveries destined for the same buyer \\nlocation from many suppliers. When using this option, a supply chain manager has to \\ndecide on the routing of each milk run. \\nDirect shipping provides the benefit of eliminating intermediate warehouses, \\nwhereas milk runs lower transportation cost by consolidating shipments to multiple \\nlocations on a single truck. For example, the replenishment lot size for each buyer loca\\xad\\ntion may be small and require LTL shipping if sent directly. The use of milk runs allows \\ndeliveries to multiple locations to be consolidated on a single truck, resulting in better \\nutilization of the truck and somewhat lower costs. Companies such as Frito-Lay that \\nmake direct store deliveries use milk runs to lower their transportation cost. If very fre\\xad\\nquent small deliveries are needed on a regular basis and either a set of suppliers or a \\nset of retailers is in geographic proximity, the use of milk runs can significantly reduce \\ntransportation costs. For example, Toyota uses milk runs from suppliers to support its \\nJIT manufacturing system in both Japan and the United States. In Japan, Toyota has \\nmany assembly plants located close together and thus uses milk runs from a single sup\\xad\\nplier to many plants. In the United States, however, Toyota uses milk runs from many \\nsuppliers to each assembly plant. \\nALL SHIPMENTS VIA CENTRAL DC \\nUnder this option, suppliers do not send shipments directly to buyer locations.

The pres\\xad\\nence of a DC allows a supply chain to achieve economies of scale for inbound trans\\xad\\nportation to a point close to the final destination, because each supplier sends a large \\nshipment to the DC that contains product for all locations the DC serves. Because DCs \\nserve locations nearby, the outbound transportation cost is not very large. For example, \\nW.W. Grainger has its suppliers ship products to one of nine DCs, which in turn replenish \\ntheir almost 400 branches. \\nIf transportation economies require very large shipments on the inbound side, \\nDCs hold inventory and send product to buyer locations in smaller replenishment lots. \\nFor example, when Wal-Mart sources from an overseas supplier, the product is held in \\ninventory at the DC because the lot size on the inbound side is much larger than the \\nsum of the lot sizes for the stores served by the DC. If replenishment lots for the buyer \\nlocations served by a DC are large enough to achieve economies of scale on inbound \\ntransportation, the DC does not need to hold inventory. In this case the DC can cross\\xad\\ndock product arriving from many suppliers on inbound trucks by breaking each \\ninbound shipment into smaller shipments that are then loaded onto trucks going to \\neach buyer location. When a DC cross-docks product, each inbound truck contains \\nproduct from a supplier for several buyer locations, whereas each outbound truck con\\xad\\ntains product for a buyer location from several suppliers. A major benefit of cross\\xad\\ndocking is that little inventory needs to be held and product flows faster in the supply \\nchain. Cross-docking also saves on handling cost because product does not have to be \\nmoved into and out of storage. Successful cross-docking, however, does require a \\nsignificant degree of coordination and synchronization between the incoming and \\noutgoing shipments. \\nCross-docking is appropriate for products with large, predictable demands and \\nrequires that DCs be set up such that economies of scale in transportation are \\nachieved on both the inbound and outbound sides. Wal-Mart has used cross-docking \\nsuccessfully to decrease inventories in the supply chain without incurring excessive \\ntransportation costs. Wal-Mart builds many large stores in a geographic area sup\\xad\\nported by a DC. As a result, the total lot size to all stores from each supplier fills \\ntrucks on the inbound side to achieve economies of scale.

The use of \\ncross-docking and milk runs allows Seven-Eleven Japan to lower its transportation \\ncost while sending small replenishment lots to each store.

If \\nDell wants to reduce its transportation costs, the company must either sacrifice respon\\xad\\nsiveness to customers or increase the number of facilities and resulting inventories to \\nmove closer to customers. \\nThe cost of coordinating operations is generally hard to quantify. Shippers should \\nevaluate different transportation options in terms of various costs as well as revenues \\nand then rank them according to coordination complexity. A manager can then make \\nthe appropriate transportation decision. Managers must consider the following trade\\xad\\noffs when making transportation decisions: \\n• Transportation and inventory cost trade-off \\n• Transportation cost and customer responsiveness trade-off \\nTRANSPORTATION AND INVENTORY COST TRADE-OFF \\nThe trade-off between transportation and inventory costs is significant when designing \\na supply chain network. Two fundamental supply chain decisions involving this trade\\xad\\noff are \\n• Choice of transportation mode \\n• Inventory aggregation \\nChoice of Transportation Mode \\nSelecting a transportation mode is both a planning and an operational decision in a \\nsupply chain. The decision regarding carriers with which a company contracts is a plan\\xad\\nning decision, whereas the choice of transportation mode for a particular shipment is \\nan operational decision.

What should the plant \\nmanager do? \\nAnalysis: Golden\\'s new proposal will result in very low transportation costs for EE if the \\nplant manager orders in lots of 400 motors. The plant manager, however, decides to \\ninclude inventory costs in the transportation decision. EE\\'s annual cost of holding inventory \\nis 25 percent, which implies an annual holding cost of H = $120 x 0.25 = $30 per motor. \\nShipments by rail require a five-day transit time, whereas shipments by truck have a transit \\ntime of three days. The transportation decision affects the cycle inventory, safety inventory, \\nand in-transit inventory for EE. Therefore, the plant manager decides to evaluate the total \\ntransportation and inventory cost for each transportation option. \\nThe AM Rail proposal requires a minimum shipment of 20,000 pounds or 2,000 motors. \\nThe replenishment lead time in this case is L = 5 + 1 = 6 days. For a lot size of Q = 2,000 \\nmotors, the plant manager obtains the following: \\nCycle inventory = 0/2 = 2,000/2 = 1,000 motors \\nSafety inventory = L/2 days of demand = (6/2)(120,000/365) \\n= 986motors \\nIn-transit inventory = 120,000(5/365) = 1 ,644 motors \\nTotal average inventory = 1, 000 + 986 + 1, 644 = 3,630 motors \\nAnnual holding cost using AM Rail = 3,630 x $30 = $108,900 \\nAM Rail charges $6.50 per cwt, resulting in a transportation cost of $0.65 per motor \\nbecause each motor weighs 1 0 pounds. Thus, \\nAnnual transportation cost using AM Rail = 120,000 x 0.65 = $78,000 \\nThe total annual cost for inventory and transportation using AM Rail is thus $186,900. \\nThe plant manager then evaluates the cost associated with each transportation option \\nas shown in Table 13-5. Based on the analysis in Table 13-5, the plant manager decides to \\nsign a contract with Golden Freightways and order motors in lots of 500. This option has \\nthe highest transportation cost but the lowest overall cost If the selection of the trans\\xad\\nportation option was made using only the transportation cost incurred, Golden\\'s new pro\\xad\\nposal lowering the price for large shipments would look attractive.

Most e-businesses use this technique to \\ngain advantage over firms with facilities in many locations. For example, Amazon.com \\nhas focused on decreasing its facility and inventory costs by holding inventory in a few \\nwarehouses, whereas booksellers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble have to hold \\ninventory in many retail stores. \\nTransportation cost, however, generally increases when inventory is aggregated. \\nIf inventories are highly disaggregated, some aggregation can also lower transportation \\ncosts. Beyond a point, however, aggregation of inventories raises total transportation \\ncosts. Consider a bookstore chain such as Borders. The inbound transportation cost to \\nBorders is due to the replenishment of bookstores with new books. There is no out\\xad\\nbound cost because customers transport their own books home. If Borders decides to \\nclose all its bookstores and sell only online, it will have to incur both inbound and out\\xad\\nbound transportation costs. The inbound transportation cost to warehouses will be \\nlower than to all bookstores. On the outbound side, however, transportation cost will \\nincrease significantly because the outbound shipment to each customer will be small \\nand will require an expensive mode such as a package carrier. The total transportation \\ncost will increase on aggregation because each book travels the same distance as when \\nit was sold through a bookstore, except that a large fraction of the distance is on the \\noutbound side using an expensive mode of transportation. As the degree of inventory \\naggregation increases, total transportation cost goes up. Thus, all firms planning inven\\xad\\ntory aggregation must consider the trade-offs among transportation, inventory, and \\nfacility costs when making this decision. \\nInventory aggregation is a good idea when inventory and facility costs form a large \\nfraction of a supply chain's total costs. Inventory aggregation is useful for products \\nwith a large value-to-weight ratio and for products with high demand uncertainty. For \\nexample, inventory aggregation is very valuable for new products in the PC industry, \\nbecause PCs have a large value-to-weight ratio and demand for new products is uncer\\xad\\ntain. Inventory aggregation is also a good idea if customer orders are large enough to \\nensure sufficient economies of scale on outbound transportation. When products have \\na low value-to-weight ratio and customer orders are small, however, inventory aggre\\xad\\ngation may hurt a supply chain's performance because of high transportation costs. \\nCompared to PCs, the value of inventory aggregation is smaller for best-selling books \\nthat have a lower value-to-weight ratio and more predictable demand. \\nWe illustrate the trade-off involved in making aggregation decisions in Example 13-2. \\nExarnple 13-2: Tradeoffs when aggregating inventory \\nHighMed, a manufacturer of medical equipment used in heart procedures, is located in \\nMadison, Wisconsin, and its products are used by cardiologists all over North America.

The fac\\xad\\ntory requires a one-week lead time to replenish finished-goods inventories at the Madison \\nwarehouse. An average customer order is for 1 unit of High Val and 10 units of Low Val. \\nWhat should HighMed do? \\nAnalysis: HighMed can reduce transportation cost by aggregating the quantity shipped \\nat a time because prices for both UPS and FedEx display economies of scale. When \\ncomparing Option A with the current system, the management team must trade off the \\nsavings in transportation cost through less frequent replenishment with the savings in \\ninventory cost with more frequent replenishment. When considering Option 8, the man\\xad\\nagement team must trade off the increase in transportation cost upon aggregation of \\ninventories and the use of a faster but more expensive carrier (FedEx) with the decrease \\nin inventory cost. \\nThe management team first analyzes the current situation. For each territory, \\nReplenishment lead time, L = 1 week \\nReorder interval, T = 4 weeks \\nCSL = 0.997 \\n1.

The increase in transportation costs is much smaller than \\nthe decrease in inventory costs resulting from smaller lots. HighMed is able to reduce total \\ncost most by aggregating all inventories and using Fed Ex for transportation, because the \\ndecrease in inventories upon aggregation is larger than the increase in transportation costs. \\nIf customer order sizes are small, the increase in transportation cost upon aggregation \\ncan be significant and inventory aggregation may increase total costs. Reconsider the case \\nof HighMed, but now each customer order averages 0.5 HighVal and 5 LowVal (half the \\nsize considered earlier). The costs for the current option as well as Option A remain \\nunchanged because HighMed does not pay for outbound transportation and incurs only the \\ncost of transporting replenishment orders under both options. Option B, however, becomes \\nmore expensive because outbound transportation costs increase with a decrease in cus\\xad\\ntomer order size. With smaller customer orders, the costs under Option B are as follows: \\nAverage weight of each customer order = 0.1 x 0.5 + 0.04 x 5 = 0.25 pounds \\nShipping cost per customer order = $5.53 + 0.53 x 0.25 = $5.66 \\nNumber of customer orders per territory per week = 4 \\nTotal customer orders per year = 4 x 24 x 52 = 4,992 \\nAnnual transportation cost = 4,992 x $5.66 = $28,255 \\nTotal annual cost = inventory cost +transportation cost \\n= $8,474 + $28,255 = $36,729 \\nThus, with small customer orders, inventory aggregation is no longer the lowest-cost \\noption for HighMed because of the large increase in transportation costs. The company is \\nbetter off maintaining inventory in each territory and using Option A, which gives a lower \\ntotal cost. \\n·--\\\\IS~\"\\'~-. tit .il?vento~·~~~r~g%~ia~~~~Pr7i#~sm~st accoun~tqrii~ven:o ?\\'i~gcftra~s\\xad\\n_-.•• /Pc)r;ta.-_ .••. -_-,_· ps~s .•• l~v~nt~ry\"~~~fe~~tip~\\\\2~cr~as.essuBB•Iyp~~inqo~ts. if_th~ pr~Odyc(~~s • \\n. ·a. higbfvalue.Cto-\"V.Jeight;r~tlcj\\',•nigf{q¥r1Jaootf~certairity,-.• arid.custofQer. or~ers ar~iargk!Jf \\n~·F!I\"o~l!ft.•.B~~g·.~···l?~I~~~4~:1§ .. · -. ·~· ·-t~fib,t~~8~ma~d•·•·u~.c~~~~~t¥·dr .. 2u~¥6.rnehaPci~rs \\n~~~~I~·7~~~~;~in~entorYa:~:~~~t~. ; :ihcr~?~~spp(?iy:9.Q~in·s?:t~·. · - .-- • -\\n. ~~~\\':;:;-\\'-, \\n\\' . \\',---.'),\n",

Temporal aggregation is the process of combining orders across time. \\nTemporal aggregation decreases a firm's responsiveness because of shipping delay but \\nalso decreases transportation costs because of economies of scale that result from \\nlarger shipments. Thus, a firm must consider the trade-off between responsiveness and \\ntransportation cost when designing its transportation network, as illustrated in \\nExample 13-3. \\nExample 13-3: Tradeoff between transportation cost and responsiveness \\nAlloy Steel is a steel service center in the Cleveland area. All orders are shipped to cus\\xad\\ntomers using an LTL carrier that charges $100 + 0.01x, where xis the number of pounds of \\nsteel shipped on the truck. Currently, Alloy Steel ships orders on the day they are received. \\nAllowing for two days in transit, this policy allows Alloy to achieve a response time of two \\ndays. Daily demand at Alloy Steel over a two-week period is shown in Table 13-7. \\nThe general manager at Alloy Steel feels that customers do not really value the two\\xad\\nday response time and would be satisfied with a four-day response. What are the cost \\nadvantages of increasing the response time? \\nAnalysis: As the response time increases, Alloy Steel has the opportunity to aggregate \\ndemand over multiple days for shipping. For a response time of three days, Alloy Steel can \\naggregate demand over two successive days before shipping. For a response time of four \\ndays, Alloy Steel can aggregate demand over three days before shipping. The manager \\nevaluates the quantity shipped and transportation costs for different response times over \\nthe two-week period as shown in Table 13-8. \\nFrom Table 13-8, observe that the transportation cost for Alloy Steel decreases as the \\nresponse time increases. The benefit of temporal consolidation, however, diminishes \\nrapidly upon increasing the response time. As the response time increases from two to \\nthree days, transportation cost over the two-week window decreases by $700. Increasing \\nthe response time from three to four days reduces the transportation cost by only $200. \\nThus, Alloy Steel may be better off offering a three-day response, because the marginal \\nbenefit from further increasing the response time is small. \\nIn general, a limited amount of temporal aggregation can be very effective in \\nreducing transportation cost in a supply chain. In choosing response time, however, \\nfirms must trade off the decrease in transportation cost upon temporal aggregation \\nwith the loss of revenue because of poorer responsiveness. Temporal consolidation also \\nimproves transportation performance because it results in more stable shipments. For \\nexample, in Table 13-7, when Alloy Steel sends daily shipments, the coefficient of vari\\xad\\nation is 0.44, whereas temporal aggregation across three days (achieved with a four-day \\nresponse time) has a coefficient of variation of only 0.16. More stable shipments allow \\nboth the shipper and the carrier to better plan operations and improve utilization of \\ntheir assets.\"),\n",

Most firms sell a variety of products \\nand serve many different customer segments. For example, W.W. Grainger sells over \\n200,000 MRO supply products to both small contractors and very large firms. Products \\nvary in size and value and customers vary in the quantity purchased, responsiveness \\nrequired, uncertainty of the orders, and distance from W.W. Grainger branches and \\nDCs. Given these differences, a firm such as W.W. Grainger should not design a com\\xad\\nmon transportation network to meet all needs. A firm can meet customer needs at a \\nlower cost by using tailored transportation to provide the appropriate transportation \\nchoice based on customer and product characteristics. In the following sections we \\ndescribe various forms of tailored transportation in supply chains. \\nTAILORED TRANSPORTATION BY CUSTOMER \\nDENSITY AND DISTANCE \\nFirms must consider customer density and distance from warehouse when designing \\ntransportation networks. The ideal transportation options based on density and dis\\xad\\ntance are shown in Table 13-9.\"),\n",

If cus\\xad\\ntomer density is high but distance from the warehouse is large, it does not pay to send \\nmilk runs from the warehouse because trucks will travel a long distance empty on the \\nreturn trip. In such a situation it is better to use a public carrier with large trucks to \\nhaul the shipments to a cross-dock center close to the customer area, where the ship\\xad\\nments are loaded onto smaller trucks that deliver product to customers using milk \\nruns. In this situation, it may not be ideal for a firm to own its own fleet. As customer \\ndensity decreases, use of an LTL carrier or a third party doing milk runs is more eco\\xad\\nnomical because the third-party carrier can aggregate shipments across many firms. If \\na firm wants to serve an area with a very low density of customers far from the ware\\xad\\nhouse, even LTL carriers may not be feasible and the use of package carriers may be the \\nbest option. Boise Cascade Office Products, an industrial distributor of office supplies, \\nhas designed a transportation network consistent with the suggestion in Table 13-9. \\nCustomer density and distance should also be considered when firms decide on the \\ndegree of temporal aggregation to use when supplying customers. Firms should serve \\nareas with high customer density more frequently because these areas are likely to \\nprovide sufficient economies of scale in transportation, making temporal aggregation \\nless valuable. To lower transportation costs, firms should use a higher degree of tempo\\xad\\nral aggregation when serving areas with a low customer density. \\nTAILORED TRANSPORTATION BY SIZE OF CUSTOMER \\nFirms must consider customer size and location when designing transportation net\\xad\\nworks. Very large customers can be supplied using a TL carrier, whereas smaller cus\\xad\\ntomers will require an LTL carrier or milk runs. When using milk runs, a shipper incurs \\ntwo types of costs: \\n• Transportation cost based on total route distance \\n• Delivery cost based on number of deliveries \\nThe transportation cost is the same whether going to a large or small customer. If a \\ndelivery is to be made to a large customer, including other small customers on the same \\ntruck can save on transportation cost. For each small customer, however, the delivery \\ncost per unit is higher than for large customers. Thus, it is not optimal to deliver to small \\nand large customers with the same frequency at the same price. One option firms have \\nis to charge a higher delivery cost for smaller customers. Another option is to tailor \\nmilk runs so that they visit larger customers with a higher frequency than smaller cus\\xad\\ntomers. Firms can partition customers into large (L), medium (M), and small (S) based \\non the demand at each. The optimal frequency of visits can be evaluated based on the \\ntransportation and delivery costs (see Section 10.2). If large customers are to be visited \\nevery milk run, medium customers every other milk run, and low-demand customers \\nevery three milk runs, suitable milk runs can be designed by combining large, medium, \\nand small customers on each run. Medium customers would be partitioned into two sub\\xad\\nsets (M 1, M 2) and small customers would be partitioned into three subsets (Sl> Sz, S3).'),\n",

The cycle inventory for high-value products with high demand is disaggre\\xad\\ngated to save on transportation costs because this allows replenishment orders to be \\ntransported less expensively.

For high-demand products \\nwith low value, all inventories should be disaggregated and held close to the customer \\nto reduce transportation costs. For low-demand, high-value products, all inventories \\nshould be aggregated to save on inventory costs. For low-demand, low-value products, \\ncycle inventories can be held close to the customer and safety inventories aggregated \\nto reduce transportation costs while taking some advantage of aggregation.

These inputs are formulated into an optimization problem whose solution is \\na set of routings and a packing list for each vehicle that minimize costs while meeting \\ndelivery constraints. \\nAlong with routing, vehicle packing software helps improve fleet utilization.

Synchronization between the pack\\xad\\ning and routing software is important because how much is packed on a truck affects \\nthe routing, while the routing obviously affects what is packed on a truck. \\nIT also comes into play in the use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and elec\\xad\\ntronic notification of impending arrivals. GPS systems monitor the real-time location of \\nvehicles. This real-time information improves a firm's response to customer questions \\nregarding deliveries. Electronic notifications are useful in a wide variety of situations, \\nranging from U.S. Customs receiving a ship's manifest days, or even weeks, before the \\nship docks in a U.S. port to a truck notifying a warehouse's receiving department that it \\nexpects to arrive 30 minutes early. Notification tools allow those receiving goods to be \\nprepared when the vehicle arrives and thus to perform all the loading, unloading, and \\ncorresponding administrative work in a more efficient manner. \\nThe most common problems in the use of IT in transportation relate to cross\\xad\\nenterprise collaboration and the narrow view taken by some transportation software. \\nCollaboration across enterprises is crucial in transportation because this is a function \\nthat is often outsourced and does not directly involve either the shipper or the cus\\xad\\ntomer. Thus, successful collaboration in transportation requires three or more firms to \\nwork together, making it much more difficult. Other problems arise because much of \\nthe transportation software is very focused on efficient routings. The software often \\noverlooks other factors such as customer service and promised delivery times, which \\nshould constrain the route selected. \\nThe players in this space include virtually all the major supply chain vendors, \\nincluding the ERP firms and the supply chain-focused best-of-breed firms. There \\nhas also been a large amount of in-house development that has focused on the \\ntransportation management process. \\n13.8 RISK MANAGEMENT IN TRANSPORTATION \\nThere are three main types of risk to consider when transporting a shipment between \\ntwo nodes on the network: \\n1. The risk that the shipment is delayed \\n2. The risk that the shipment does not reach its destination because intermediate \\nnodes or links are disrupted by external forces \\n3. The risk of hazardous material \\nIn each case it is important to identify the sources of risk and their consequences and \\nplan suitable mitigation strategies. \\nDelay arises either because of congestion along links such as roads or nodes such \\nas ports and airports. When congestion is the cause of delay, mitigation strategies for \\nthe shipper include moving inventories closer to the destination, using alternative \\nlanes, and building a buffer into the lead time. Congestion delays can be mitigated by \\ndesigning a network with multiple routes to the destination and changing routes based \\non congestion. Congestion delays can also be mitigated through the use of congestion \\npricing by the owner of the transportation node or link. Delay may also arise because of \\nthe limited availability of transportation or infrastructure capacity. Such delays are more \\nlikely when the assets are owned by a third party that is serving multiple customers. \\nThese delays may be mitigated by owning some transportation capacity or by signing \\nlong-term contracts for transportation capacity with the third party. Given the high cost \\nof owning these assets, it is best to do so for parts of the network where utilization is high.\"),\n",

The best mitigation strategy \\nin this case is to design alternative routings into the transportation network. For exam\\xad\\nple, the 1994 Kobe earthquake in Japan disrupted flow for all firms using the port. Some \\ncompanies, such as Toyota, were able to recover quickly because they increased the flow \\nthrough alternative ports in their network. Similarly, during the California dockworkers' \\nstrike in 2002, many companies arranged for alternative ports to bring in product. \\nWhen considering both delay and disruption risk, it is important to identify sources \\nthat are likely to be correlated across the network. For example, the events on \\nSeptember 11, 2001, caused a disruption in air transportation across the entire United \\nStates. Alternative routings were useless as mitigation strategies in this case because no \\nalternative route was available. For such correlated sources of risk, the only option is to \\ndecrease the probability of such a disruption. \\nHazardous material can be harmful when people or the environment are exposed. \\nThe goal of risk mitigation here is to minimize the probability of exposure, and in the \\nevent of exposure, to minimize the impact. Mitigation strategies include the use of \\nmodified containers, low-risk transportation modes, selecting routes with low accident \\nprobability or reduced population and environmental exposure, or modification of the \\nphysical or chemical properties of the material being transported to make it less \\ndangerous. \\n13.9 MAKING TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS IN PRACTICE \\n1. Align transportation strategy with competitive strategy. Managers should ensure that \\na firm's transportation strategy supports its competitive strategy. They should design \\nfunctional incentives that help achieve this goal. Historically, the transportation func\\xad\\ntion within firms has been evaluated based on the extent to which it can lower trans\\xad\\nportation costs. Such a focus leads to decisions that lower transportation costs but hurt \\nthe level of responsiveness provided to customers and may raise the firm's total cost. If \\nthe dispatcher at a DC is evaluated based solely on the extent to which trucks are \\nloaded, he or she is likely to delay shipments and hurt customer responsiveness to \\nachieve a larger load. Firms should evaluate the transportation function based on a \\ncombination of transportation cost, inventory cost, and the level of responsiveness \\nachieved with customers. \\n2. Consider both in-house and outsourced transportation. Managers should consider an \\nappropriate combination of company-owned and outsourced transportation to meet \\ntheir needs. This decision should be based on a firm's ability to handle transportation \\nprofitably as well as the strategic importance of transportation to the success of the \\nfirm. In general, outsourcing is a better option when shipment sizes are small, whereas \\nowning the transportation fleet is better when shipment sizes are large and responsive\\xad\\nness is important. For example, Wal-Mart uses responsive transportation to reduce \\ninventories in its supply chain. Given the importance of transportation to the success of \\nits strategy, it owns its transportation fleet and manages it itself. This is made easier by \\nthe fact that it achieves good utilization from its transportation assets because most of \\nits shipments are large. In contrast, firms such as W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr \\nsend small shipments to customers; inventory management rather than transportation \\nis the key to their success. A third-party carrier can lowercosts for them by aggregating \\ntheir shipments with those of other companies. As a result, both companies use third\\xad\\nparty carriers for their transportation.\"),\n",

Use technology to improve transportation peiformance. Managers must use informa\\xad\\ntion technology to decrease costs and improve responsiveness in their transportation \\nnetworks. Software helps managers do transportation planning, modal selection, and \\nbuild delivery routes and schedules. Available technology allows carriers to identify the \\nprecise location of each vehicle as well as the shipments the vehicle carries. Satellite\\xad\\nbased communication systems allow carriers to communicate with each vehicle in their \\nfleet. These technologies help carriers lower costs and become more responsive to \\nchanges. \\n4. Design flexibility into the transportation network. When designing transportation \\nnetworks, managers should take into account uncertainty in demand as well as avail\\xad\\nability of transportation. Ignoring uncertainty encourages a greater use of inexpensive \\nand inflexible transportation modes that perform well when everything goes as \\nplanned. Such networks, however, perform very poorly when plans change. When man\\xad\\nagers account for uncertainty, they are more likely to include flexible, though more \\nexpensive, modes of transportation within their network. Although these modes may be \\nmore expensive for a particular shipment, including them in the transportation options \\nallows a firm to reduce the overall cost of providing a high level of responsiveness. \\n13.10 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Understand the role of transportation within a supply chain. \\nTransportation refers to the movement of product from one location to another within \\na supply chain. The importance of transportation has grown with the increasing globalization \\nin supply chains as well as the growth in e-commerce because both trends increase the dis\\xad\\ntance products travel. Transportation decisions impact supply chain profitability and influ\\xad\\nence both inventory and facility decisions within a supply chain. \\n2. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different modes of transportation. \\nThe various modes of transportation include water, rail, intermodal, truck, air, pipeline, \\nand package carriers. Water is typically the least expensive mode but is also the slowest, \\nwhereas air and package carriers are the most expensive and the fastest. Rail and water are \\nbest suited for low-value, large shipments that do not need to be moved in a hurry. Air and \\npackage carriers are best suited for small, high-value, emergency shipments. Intermodal and \\nTL carriers are faster than rail and water but somewhat more expensive. LTL carriers are best \\nsuited for small shipments that are too large for package carriers but much less than a TL. \\n3. Discuss the role of infrastructure and policies in transportation. \\nInfrastructure such as ports, roads, and airports has a significant impact on trans\\xad\\nportation. Given their inherent monopolistic nature, most transportation infrastructure \\nrequires public ownership or regulation. In the case of public ownership, pricing based on \\naverage cost leads to overutilization and congestion. It is important to use some form of \\ncongestion pricing under which users are forced to internalize the increase in network cost \\nthey cause. \\n4. Identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of various transportation network design \\noptions. \\nNetworks are designed to either ship directly from origin to destination or move the \\nproduct through a consolidation point. Direct shipments are most effective when large \\nquantities are to be moved. When shipments are small, use of an intermediate warehouse or \\nDC lowers transportation cost by aggregating smaller shipments even though it takes longer \\nand is more complex. Shipments may also be consolidated with a single vehicle either pick\\xad\\ning up from multiple locations or dropping off in multiple locations.'),\n",

Sourcing is the entire set of business processes required to purchase \\ngoods and services. For any supply chain function, the most significant decision is \\nwhether to outsource the function or perform it in-house. Outsourcing results in the \\nsupply chain function being performed by a third party. Outsourcing is one of the most \\nimportant issues facing a firm, and actions across industries tend to be varied. For \\nexample, WW. Grainger, a MRO distributor, has consistently owned and managed its \\ndistribution centers. In contrast, outbound transportation of packages from distribu\\xad\\ntion centers to customers has consistently been outsourced to a third party. For less\\xad\\nthan-truckload outbound transportation, Grainger is moving from a scenario under \\nwhich it was all outsourced to a third party to a hybrid model under which Grainger \\nowns some trucks. What factors can explain Grainger's decisions? Dell is credited with \\nimproving profits by keeping the retail function in-house and selling directly to cus\\xad\\ntomers. In contrast, Proctor & Gamble (P&G) has never attempted to sell detergent \\ndirectly to customers, and nobody is calling on it to bring the retail function in-house. \\nWhat makes vertical integration into retailing a good idea for Dell but a bad idea for \\nP&G? Motorola uses a distributor for the sale of its cell phones in most of Latin \\nAmerica. In contrast, most of its sales in the United States do not go through distribu\\xad\\ntors. Why is the outsourcing of distribution for Motorola beneficial in Latin America \\nbut not in the United States? \\nIt is important to clarify the distinction between outsourcing and off-shoring \\nbefore we proceed. A firm off-shores a supply chain function if it maintains ownership \\nbut moves the production facility offshore. In contrast, a firm outsources if the firm\"),\n",

In this chapter our focus is on the issue of outsourcing rather than off\\xadshoring. We address the outsourcing of supply chain activities based on the following two questions: \\n1. Will the third party increase the supply chain surplus relative to performing the activity in house? \\n2. To what extent do risks grow upon outsourcing? \\nRecall that the supply chain surplus is the difference between the value of a prod\\xaduct for the customer and the total cost of all supply chain activities involved in bringing the product to the customer. The supply chain surplus is the total size of the pie that all supply chain participants (including the customer) get to share. Our basic premise is that outsourcing makes sense if it increases the supply chain surplus without signifi\\xadcantly affecting risks. We go further and claim that a supply chain participant can sur\\xadvive in the long term only if its presence increases the supply chain surplus. One can then argue that each party's profit in a supply chain is correlated with the extent to which it increases the surplus. \\nOnce a decision to outsource has been made, sourcing processes include the selec\\xadtion of suppliers, design of supplier contracts, product design collaboration, procure\\xadment of material or services, and evaluation of supplier performance, as shown in Figure 14-1. . \\nSupplier scoring and assessment is the process used to rate supplier performance. Suppliers should be compared based on their impact on the supply chain surplus and total cost. Unfortunately, sourcing decisions are often driven based solely on the price charged by a supplier. Many other supplier characteristics, such as lead time, reliability, quality, and design capability, also affect the total cost of doing business with a supplier. A good supplier scoring and assessment process must identify and track performance along all dimensions that affect the total cost of using a supplier. Supplier selection uses the output from supplier scoring and assessment to identify the appropriate supplier(s). A supply contract is then negotiated with the supplier. A good contract should account for all factors that affect supply chain performance and should be designed to increase supply chain profits in a way that benefits both the supplier and the buyer. \\nGiven that about 80 percent of the cost of a product is determined during design, it is crucial that suppliers be actively involved at this stage. Design collaboration allows the supplier and the manufacturer to work together when designing components for the final product. Design collaboration also ensures that any design changes are com\\xadmunicated effectively to all parties involved with designing and manufacturing the product. Once the product has been designed, procurement is the process whereby the supplier sends product in response to orders placed by the buyer. The goal of procure\\xadment is to enable orders to be placed and delivered on schedule at the lowest possible \\noverall cost. Finally, the role of sourcing planning and analysis is to analyze spending \\nSupplier \\nScoring \\nand Assessment \\nand \\nContract \\nNegotiation \\nDesign Procurement Collaboration \\nSourcing \\nPlanning \\nand \\nAnalysis\"),\n",

Within COGS, purchased parts are a much higher fraction than they \\nwere several decades ago. This change has occurred because companies have reduced \\nvertical integration and outsourced manufacture of many components. Companies \\nsuch as Cisco have gone further and also outsourced a significant fraction of the \\nassembly capacity. As there is greater pressure on firms to achieve lower costs and the \\nsuppliers' share of the COGS grows, good sourcing decisions will have greater impact \\non the cost leadership and competitive advantage enjoyed by a firm. \\nEffective sourcing processes within a firm can improve profits for the firm and total \\nsupply chain surplus in a variety of ways. It is important that the drivers of improved \\nprofits be clearly identified when making sourcing decisions. Some of the benefits from \\neffective sourcing decisions are the following: \\n• Better economies of scale can be achieved if orders within a firm are aggregated. \\n• More efficient procurement transactions can significantly reduce the overall cost \\nof purchasing. This is most important for items for which a large number of low\\xad\\nvalue transactions occur. \\n• Design collaboration can result in products that are easier to manufacture and \\ndistribute, resulting in lower overall costs. This factor is most important for sup\\xad\\nplier products that contribute a significant amount to product cost and value. \\n• Good procurement processes can facilitate coordination with the supplier and \\nimprove forecasting and planning. Better coordination lowers inventories and \\nimproves the matching of supply and demand. \\n• Appropriate supplier contracts can allow for the sharing of risk, resulting in \\nhigher profits for both the supplier and the buyer. \\n• Firms can achieve a lower purchase price by increasing competition through the \\nuse of auctions. \\nWhen designing a sourcing strategy, it is important for a firm to be clear on the fac\\xad\\ntors that have the greatest influence on performance and target improvement on those \\nareas. For example, if most of the spending for a firm is on materials with only a few high\\xad\\nvalue transactions, improving the efficiency of procurement transactions will provide lit\\xad\\ntle value, whereas improving design collaboration and coordination with the supplier will \\nprovide significant value. In contrast, when sourcing items with many low-value transac\\xad\\ntions, increasing the efficiency of procurement transactions will be very valuable. \\nIn the next section we discuss factors that influence the outsourcing decision. \\n14.2 IN-HOUSE OR OUTSOURCE \\nThe decision to outsource is based on the growth in supply chain surplus provided by \\nthe third party and the increase in risk incurred by using a third party. A firm should \\nconsider outsourcing if the growth in surplus is large with a small increase in risk. \\nPerforming the function in-house is preferable if the growth in surplus is small or the \\nincrease in risk is large. \\nHOW DO THIRD PARTIES INCREASE THE SUPPLY CHAIN SURPLUS \\nThird parties increase the supply chain surplus if they either increase value for the cus\\xad\\ntomer or decrease the supply chain cost relative to a firm performing the taskin-house.\"),\n",

We discuss various mechanisms that third parties can use to grow the surplus. \\n1. Capacity aggregation. A third party can increase the supply chain surplus by aggre\\xadgating demand across multiple firms and gaining production economies of scale that no single firm can on its own. This is the most common reason for outsourcing production in a supply chain. One of the reasons that Dell outsources design and production of the processors in its PCs to Intel is that Intel supplies many computer manufacturers and gains economies of scale that are not available to Dell if it designs and produces its own processors. The growth in surplus from outsourcing is highest when the needs of the firm are significantly lower than the volumes required to gain economies of scale. A good example in this context is Magna Steyr, a third party that has taken over assembly of automobiles for several manufacturers. Magna Steyr has developed very flexible capacity and labor that allows it to produce economically cars that sell in low volumes. It produces the X3 for BMW, the G class for Mercedes, and the Grand Cherokee for Chrysler. In each case, the models have relatively low demand volume. Each firm would not be able to gain sufficient economies of scale for assembling their model. There is a cost to this flexibility that cannot be justified based on one model, but Magna Steyr gains economies by serving many auto firms. A third party is unlikely to increase the surplus through capacity aggregation if the volume requirements of a firm are large and stable. This is substantiated by the fact that no auto manufacturer out\\xadsources production of its best-selling cars to a third party. \\n2. Inventory aggregation. A third party can increase the supply chain surplus by aggre\\xadgating inventories across a large number of customers. W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr are MRO suppliers that provide value primarily by aggregating inventory for hundreds of thousands of customers. Aggregation allows them to significantly lower overall uncertainty and improve economies of scale in purchasing and transportation. As a result, these MRO distributors carry significantly less safety and cycle inventory than would be required if each customer decided to carry inventory on its own. Another example of inventory aggregation is Brightstar, a distributor that facilitates postpone\\xadment for cell phones. These phones are manufactured in the Far East and shipped to the Brightstar warehouse in Miami, where software and accessories are added as customer orders arrive from South America. High product variety and many small customers allow Brightstar to increase the supply chain surplus through inventory aggregation and postponement. The third party performing inventory aggregation adds most to the supply chain surplus when demand from customers is fragmented and uncertain. When demand is large and predictable, an intermediary adds little to the surplus by holding inventory. The consolidation of retailing and the resulting scale and predictability of demand explains why distributors play a much smaller role in the United States com\\xadpared to developing countries. \\n3. Transportation aggregation by transportation intermediaries. A third party may increase the surplus by aggregating the transportation function to a higher level than any shipper can on its own. UPS, FedEx, and a host of LTL carriers are examples of trans\\xadportation intermediaries that increase the supply chain surplus by aggregating trans\\xadportation across a variety of shippers. The value provided in each case is driven by the inherent economies of scale in transportation. Each shipper wants to send less than the capacity of the transportation mode. The transportation intermediary aggregates ship\\xadments across multiple shippers, thus lowering the cost of each shipment below what could be achieved by the shipper alone. A transportation intermediary increases the supply chain surplus when shippers are sending packages or LTL quantities to customers that \\n-~~ --~ ·---··------~-~ -'),\n",

A transportation intermediary can also grow the sur\\xad\\nplus for TL shippingby aggregating backhauls to a higher level than the shipp'er can. \\nThis is particularly true if the shipper's transportation flows are highly unbalanced, \\nwith the quantity coming into a region very different from the quantity leaving the \\nregion. An excellent example of a transportation intermediary increasing the supply \\nchain surplus is provided by a pilot program involving DaimlerChrysler and Ford. \\nExel, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider, operated a dedicated fleet for the distribu\\xad\\ntion of spare parts for Chrysler. In tests in Michigan and Mexico, Ford added its own \\ntruck parts for delivery on the same fleet. Given the relatively low density of dealers in \\nNorthern Michigan and Mexico (outside Mexico City), the aggregation provided by \\nExel was a benefit for both Ford and DaimlerChrysler. A transportation intermediary \\nis likely to add the least to the supply chain surplus for a company such as Wal-Mart, \\nfor whom shipment sizes are large and the company also achieves aggregation across \\nthe many retail stores that it owns. The only possibility for a transportation intermedi\\xad\\nary in such a setting would be to obtain better backhauls than Wal-Mart. \\n4. Transportation aggregation by storage intermediaries. A third party that stores \\ninventory can also increase the supply chain surplus by aggregating inbound and out\\xad\\nbound transportation. For example, storage intermediaries such as W.W. Grainger and \\nMcMaster-Carr stock products from over a thousand manufacturers each and sell to \\nhundreds of thousands of customers. On the inbound side they are able to aggregate \\nshipments from several manufacturers onto a single truck. This results in a lower trans\\xad\\nportation cost than could be achieved by each manufacturer independently. On the \\noutbound side they aggregate packages for customers at a common destination, result\\xad\\ning in a significantly lower transportation cost than can be achieved by each customer \\nseparately. For example, the Chicago distribution center for Grainger fills separate \\ntrucks with packages destined for each adjacent state. As soon as a truck destined for \\nMichigan (for instance) is filled, it is sent to the UPS sorting facility in Michigan. This \\nlevel of aggregation cannot be achieved by customers on their own. Thus, the storage of \\ngoods by Grainger and McMaster-Carr increases the supply chain surplus by aggregat\\xad\\ning inbound and outbound transportation. A similar service is provided by distributors \\nin countries such as India. Given the small size of retail outlets, a distributor aggregates \\ndelivery for several manufacturers, significantly lowering the outbound transportation \\ncost. This form of aggregation is most effective if the intermediary stocks products \\nfrom many suppliers and serves many customers, each ordering in small quantities. This \\nform of aggregation becomes less effective as the scale of shipment from a supplier to \\ncustomer gr_ows. This is seen in the decreased use of distributors by U.S. supermarket \\nchains. The supermarkets typically get full trucks delivered on their own and do not \\nneed a distributor for further aggregation. \\n5. Warehousing aggregation. A third party may increase the supply chain surplus by \\naggregating warehousing needs over several customers. The growth in surplus is \\nachieved in terms of lower real estate costs as well as lower processing costs within the \\nwarehouse. Savings through warehousing aggregation arise if a supplier's warehousing \\nneeds are small or if its needs fluctuate over time. In either case, the intermediary with \\nthe warehouse can exploit economies of scale in warehouse construction and operation \\nby aggregating across multiple customers. An example is Safexpress, a third-party logis\\xad\\ntics provider in India. Safexpress owns warehouses distributed throughout the country \\nthat are used by many of their customers.

For example, the warehousing needs for \\nWal-Mart and Grainger are sufficiently large and stable to justify their own warehouse, \\nand a third party is unlikely to increase the surplus. \\n6. Procurement aggregation. A third party increases the supply chain surplus if it \\naggregates procurement for many small players and facilitates economies of scale in \\nproduction and inbound transportation. Procurement aggregation is most effective \\nacross many small buyers. A good example is FleetXchange, a firm that offers small \\ntruck fleets lower prices for truck equipment and services through aggregate buying. \\nProcurement aggregation is not likely to be a big factor in a situation with a few large \\ncustomers. For example, contract manufacturers in the electronics industry have not \\nconvinced their large customers, such as HP and Motorola, to outsource the procure\\xad\\nment function. Both HP and Motorola are large enough that there is very little mar\\xad\\nginal benefit from further aggregation, whereas there is a potential downside in that \\nthey would cede the relationship with the supplier to the contract manufacturer if they \\noutsourced procurement. For a small electronics company, however, the procurement \\naggregation offered by a contract manufacturer could add significantly to the supply \\nchain surplus. \\n7. Information aggregation. A third party may increase the surplus by aggregating \\ninformation to a higher level than can be achieved by a firm performing the function \\nin-house. All retailers aggregate information on products from many manufacturers in \\na single location. This information aggregation reduces search costs for customers. \\neBags is an example of a retailer that provides primarily information aggregation, and \\nlittle else. eBags hold very little inventory but is a single point of display for informa\\xad\\ntion on bags from many manufacturers. By aggregating product information, eBags \\nsignificantly reduces search costs for the online customer. Relative to eBags, if each man\\xad\\nufacturer set up its own Web site and online store, search costs for the customer would \\nbe higher and each manufacturer would have to invest in the information infrastruc\\xad\\nture. Thus, eBags increases the supply chain surplus through information aggregation \\nby making search cheaper and reducing investment in information technology. Two \\nother examples of information aggregation include W.W. Grainger and McMaster-Carr. \\nBoth provide a product catalog and a very detailed Web site. This simplifies search by \\nthe customer and aggregates product information for over a thousand manufacturers. \\nAnother excellent example of information aggregation is provided by the various \\nonline sites, such as America's Loads On-Line, that bring together shippers and truck\\xad\\ners looking for backhauls. Information aggregation reduces search costs and allows \\nbetter matching of truckers and shipments. Information aggregation increases the sur\\xad\\nplus if both buyers and sellers are fragmented and buying is sporadic. Information \\naggregation is not likely to be a big factor for a car manufacturer that regularly buys \\nsteel from a single supplier. \\n8. Receivables aggregation. A third party may increase the supply chain surplus if it \\ncan aggregate the receivables risk to a higher level than the firm or it has a lower col\\xad\\nlection cost than the firm. BrightStar is a distributor for Motorola in most Latin \\nAmerican countries other than Brazil. Cell phones in the area are sold through many \\nsmall, independently owned retail outlets. Collecting receivables from each retail out\\xad\\nlet is a very expensive proposition for a manufacturer. Given that a retailer buys from \\nmany manufacturers, the power of each manufacturer to collect is also reduced. \\nBrightstar, as a distributor, is able to aggregate collection across all manufacturers \\n(that it serves), reducing the collec.tion cost. By aggregating collection to a greater \\nextent than any one manufacturer can, Brightstar also lowers the default risk. Reduced\"),\n",

The same is true with distributors \\nin India that often distribute for a large number of manufacturers to the same retailer. Given their ability to aggregate across many manufacturers and small retailers, distrib\\xadutors in India typically take responsibility for managing receivables from the retailers. Receivables aggregation is likely to increase the supply chain surplus if retail outlets are small and numerous and each outlet stocks products from many manufacturers \\nthat are all served by the same distributor. Such a scenario is more likely in developing countries where retailing is fragmented. It is less likely in developed countries such as the United States and most of Western Europe, where retailing is consolidated. \\n9. Relationship aggregation. An intermediary can increase the supply chain surplus by decreasing the number of relationships required between multiple buyers and sell\\xaders. Without an intermediary, connecting a thousand sellers to a million buyers requires a billion relationships. The presence of an intermediary lowers the number of relation\\xadships required to just over a million. Most retailers and MRO distributors such as W.W. Grainger improve supply chain surplus through relationship aggregation. Relationship \\naggregation increases the supply chain surplus by increasing the size of each transac\\xadtion and decreasing their number. Relationship aggregation is most effective when many buyers sporadically purchase small amounts at a time but each order often has products from multiple suppliers. Thus, Grainger can increase the surplus by being a rela\\xadtionship aggregator for MRO products. A third party, however, does not increase the surplus by being a relationship aggregator between a few buyers and sellers where the relationships are longer term and large. For example, Covisint has failed to become a relationship aggregator in the automotive industry, especially for direct materials. \\n10. Lower costs and higher quality. A third party can increase the supply chain surplus if it provides lower cost or higher quality relative to the firm. If these benefits come from specialization and learning, they are likely to be sustainable over the longer term. A specialized third party that is further along the learning curve for some supply chain activity is likely to maintain its advantage over the long term. A common scenario, however, is one in which the third party has a low-cost location that the firm does not. In such a situation, lower labor and overhead costs are temporary reasons for out\\xadsourcing, because if the wage differential is persistent and the third party offers none of the other advantages discussed earlier, it is best for the firm to maintain ownership and off-shore production to the low-cost location. \\n> •. kE:~,;~diNT·········Atgrr~,partY.ri,ayb~ able:t() ••. prbVide.a\\'s.u~taihable •• 9rowt~ .of.tbe surpfUsi ·.·. \\n·~ :··p~~·~[9·f~~·~\\\\~9\\'f(?\"~~~r9~er(Jexer f~~htfle tirrrii~~~lf: Tne 9r9~thiQ. su rplus\\'cornestrorlit \\nt: ..... · .• ~~g.r~~~ti~gcap~2\\\\~Y:,}ny~btpryiin~oiJ~·~··ar .•.

If the scale is large, it is very likely that sufficient economies of scale are achieved internal to the firm itself. In this case it is very unlikely that a third party can achieve further scale economies and increase the surplus.

For its outbound packages, even though Grainger has a larg number going out, they are distributed geographically and Grainger would not be abl to achieve economies of scale for door-to-door delivery. A third party package carrie adds to the surplus in this case. The second important factor is the uncertainty of a firm's needs. If the needs are ver: predictable, the increase in surplus from a third party is limited, especially if the firn has sufficient scale. In contrast, if the firm's needs are highly variable over time, th1 third party can increase the surplus through aggregation with other customers. Fo1 example, Grainger has predictable needs in terms of warehouse space required. Giver sufficient scale, it owns and operates its own distribution centers. In contrast, mos1 firms have very uncertain demand for MRO products. They prefer not to hold these items in stock and use Grainger as an intermediary. Finally, the growth in surplus is influenced by the specificity of assets required by the third party. If the assets required are specific to a firm and cannot be used for oth\\xaders, a third party is unlikely to increase the surplus because all it does is move the assets from one firm to another. The third party has no opportunity to aggregate across other customers. For example, if a distributor holds inventory that is specific to a customer, the distributor is unable to aggregate it to a higher level than the customer. The pres\\xadence of the distributor does not increase the surplus in this case. Similarly, if a third\\xadparty logistics provider manages a warehouse exclusively for a single firm, it has few opportunities to increase the surplus unless it can aggregate the use of management or information systems across other warehouses. In contrast, if assets (inventory or ware\\xadhouses in the above examples) are less specific and can be used across multiple firms, a third party can increase the surplus by aggregating uncertainty across multiple customers or improving economies of scale. The above discussion on how and when a third party can increase the supply chain surplus is summarized in Table 14-1. \\nRISKS OF USING A THIRD PARTY \\nFirms must evaluate the following risks when they move a~y function to a third party. 1.

The first step should be to get the process under control, then do a cost-benefit analysis, and only then decide on outsourcing. \\n2. Underestimation of the cost of coordination. A common mistake when outsourcing is to underestimate the effort required to coordinate activities across multiple entities performing supply chain tasks. This is especially true if a firm plans to outsource spe\\xadcific supply chain functions to different third parties. Outsourcing functions to many third parties is feasible (and can be very effective) if the firm views being a coordina\\xadtor as one of its core strengths. A good example of a strong coordinator is Cisco. However, even Cisco ran into trouble in the early 2000s and was left with a lot of sur\\xadplus inventory because of coordination problems. An example where coordination caused problems was between Nike and i2 Technologies in 2000. Nike blamed its loss of $100 million on inventory management glitches that it attributed to the supply chain planning software from i2. i2 in turn blamed the problems on Nike's execution of the software. Clearly, insufficient coordination between the two firms played a role in this failure. \\n3. Reduced customer/supplier contact. A firm may lose customer/supplier contact by introducing an intermediary. The loss of customer contact is particularly significant for firms that sell directly to consumers but decide to use a third party to either collect incoming orders or deliver outgoing product. A good example is Boise Cascade, which outsourced all its outbound distribution to third parties. This led to a significant loss of customer contact. Boise Cascade decided to bring outbound delivery for customers located close to their distribution centers in-house. Given the high density of cus\\xadtomers around their distribution centers, the additional gain in surplus that a third party could provide was minimal, while the gain from improved customer contact was significant. Boise Cascade did not bring distribution beyond this point in-house because the gain in surplus provided by a third party was significant. \\n4. Loss of internal capability and growth in third-party power. A firm may choose to keep a supply chain function in-house if outsourcing will significantly increase the third party's power. An example can be found in the electronics industry. Companies such as HP and Motorola have moved most of their manufacturing to contract manufac\\xadturers but are reluctant to move either procurement or design, even though contract manufacturers have developed both capabilities. Given the commonality of compo\\xadnents, it can be argued that a contract manufacturer can achieve a higher level of aggregation in procurement as well as design assets. HP and Motorola, however, are reluctant to move procurement to contract manufacturers because the potential loss in power is large whereas the aggregation gains are small given the relatively large size of both firms. Keeping part of a supply chain function in-house is also important if a complete loss of capability significantly strengthens the third party's bargaining position. The in-house capability then serves as an option that can be exercised when the need arises. The option also limits how much of the supply chain surplus the third party can keep for itself. \\n5. Leakage of sensitive data and information. Using a third party requires a firm to share demand information and in some cases intellectual property. If the third party also serves competitors, there is always the danger of leakage. Firms have often insisted on firewalls within the third party, but a firewall increases the specificity of assets, limiting the growth in surplus that the third party can provide. When leakage is an issue, especially with regard to intellectual property, firms often choose to keep the function in-house. \\n6. Ineffective contracts. Contracts with performance metrics that distort the third party's incentives often significantly reduce any gains from outsourcing. For example,\"),\n",

This form of pricing eliminates incentives for the third party to \\ninnovate further to reduce costs. The onus for improvement falls back on the firm. \\nAnother example is when firms require suppliers or distributors to maintain a certain \\nnumber of days of inventory as part of the contract. Such a contract reduces the third \\nparty's incentive to take actions that reduce inventories. In such a situation it is better \\nfor the firm to contract on a desired service level and leave the third party more free\\xad\\ndom with regard to the amount of inventory.

Traditionally, 3PLs focused on specific functions such as transportation, \\nwarehousing, and information technology within the supply chain. Armstrong's Guide \\nto 3PLs & Global Logistics Services (Armstrong & Associates, Inc., 2001) describes \\nsome of the services offered by 3PLs, as shown in Table 14-2. \\nMost 3PLs started out by focusing on one of the functions in the supply chain. For \\nexample, UPS started out as a small-package carrier. Schneider started out as a truck\\xad\\nload carrier. Over the years, however, as the basic functions have become commodi\\xad\\ntized, 3PLs have expanded their range of services. There are still several customers that \\nuse 3PLs to perform a specific function. For example, Grainger handles most of the \\norder-to delivery-cycle itself, except for outbound transportation, which is outsourced \\nto UPS. UPS clearly increases the surplus in this case given the geographic distribution \\nof Grainger's customers and the small order sizes.

The wide range of ser\\xad\\nvice allowed UPS to sign a contract to manage the global supply chain for National \\nSemiconductor Corporation. UPS manages the movement of chips from National \\nSemiconductor\\'s plants to a global distribution center and on to customers around the \\nworld. Similarly, Schneider Logistics offers a wide variety of services beyond truckload \\ntransportation. For the General Motors Spare Parts Operations (GMSPO), Schneider \\nprovides comprehensive logistics services from order placement to final payment. \\nThe trend of outsourcing a broader range of supply chain services has been grow\\xad\\ning since the late 1990s. With the increased globalization of supply chains, customers \\nare looking for players that can manage virtually all aspects of their supply chain. This \\nhas led to the concept of a fourth-party logistics ( 4PL) provider. A 4PL was first \\ndefined by Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) as \"an integrator that assembles the \\nresources, capabilities and technology of its own organization and other organizations \\nto design, build and run comprehensive supply chain solutions.\"1 Whereas a 3PL targets \\na function, a 4PL targets management of the entire process. Some have described a \\n4PL as a general contractor who manages other 3PLs, truckers, forwarders, custom bro\\xad\\nkers, and others, essentially taking responsibility of a complete process for the cus\\xad\\ntomer. When the idea was first formulated, Andersen conceived a neutral 4PL that did \\nnot own any logistics assets itself but only managed various logistics providers. The \\nreality has been somewhat different. Hardly any neutral4PLs have managed to estab\\xad\\nlish themselves. Many 3PLs, however, have started providing integrated services by \\nwhich they serve as a 4PL and a lead logistics provider, covering some of the functions \\nthemselves. \\nOne example of a lead logistics provider is Menlo Logistics, which manages all \\naspects of the supply chain for HomeLife, a national home furnishings retail chain. \\nMenlo designs the supply chain and information systems and integrates transportation, \\nwarehousing, home delivery, product setup and repair, and reverse logistics for \\nHomeLife. The solution involves some distribution centers that are operated by Menlo \\nand other distribution centers that are ,operated by other third parties managed by \\nMenlo. Menlo also has a centralized command center to manage and track other sup\\xad\\nply chain activities. Menlo has also supplied HomeLife with information systems to \\nmanage orders, warehouses, transportation, and home delivery. Another example is \\nKuehne & Nagel AG, a Swiss freight forwarder. It has formed Kuehne & Nagel Lead \\nLogistics (K&N), which is positioned as a 4PL. In 2002 Nortel Networks hired K&N to \\nhandle all its outbound logistics from factories to customers. K&N now manages 35 to \\n40 forwarders, warehouse managers, truckers, and other logistics providers worldwide \\nfor Nortel. K&N itself provides some of these services to Nortel. \\nA fundamental question is how a 4PL adds value relative to a firm managing its \\nown logistics providers. This is particularly relevant in the case of K&N and Nortel \\nbecause K&N took on nearly 100 Nortel employees who were managing the supply \\nchain earlier. One answer often put forth is that outsourcing to someone like K&N \\nallows Nortel to apply its limited capital toward its core business. Keep in mind, how\\xad\\never, that outsourcing a noncore activity such as logistics does not guarantee any \\ngrowth in the supply chain surplus. The K&N and Nortel relationship can survive in the \\nlong term only if K&N can increase the surplus in a way that Nortel cannot. The fun\\xad\\ndamental advantage that a 4PL may provide comes from greater visibility and coordi\\xad\\nnation over a firm\\'s supply chain and improved handoffs between logistics providers. \\nGreater visibility and coordination requires the use of sophisticated information tech\\xad\\nnology. Given the high cost of development or purchase of this technology, and the \\n1Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4PL on January 29,2006.'),\n",

Many 4PLs have developed their own suite of IT \\napplications, whereas others integrate across IT applications from multiple providers. \\nFor example, Schneider Logistics has a suite called SUMIT, whereas Exel plc Americas \\nuses applications from a variety of providers such as i2 Technologies and CAPS. A 4PL \\ncan also increase the supply chain surplus by effectively aggregating demands from \\ncustomers and capacity of logistics providers. \\nAn excellent example of a firm that does both is Li & Fung, which has built a $2 \\nbillion business helping global companies such as Reebok manage sourcing and pro\\xad\\nduction across many locations in the developing world. The company has been an \\nintermediary between suppliers in the developing world and global buyers since it was \\nfounded in 1906. Li & Fung originally exported jade, porcelain, and silk from China to \\nthe United States. In the 1970s the firm expanded its network of suppliers and is now \\nable to get around regional trade umbrellas such as the European Union and NAFTA \\nby sourcing appropriately. Li & Fung is an information hub that is able to link thou\\xad\\nsands of factories in 32 countries to almost a thousand customers in an optimal man\\xad\\nner. Li & Fung reserves 30 to 70 percent of a supplier's capacity. These factories are \\naccustomed to reliable repeat business from Li & Fung and are thus willing to commit \\nthis capacity. Li & Fung maintains detailed capability information for each factory that \\nis used to match it to appropriate customer orders as they arrive. For its customers, Li \\n& Fung facilitates short-lead-time production. This allows customers to observe sales \\ntrends before committing to an order. When an order arrives, Li & Fung procures yarn \\nfrom one supplier, gets on the production schedule of a weaving mill, and finally farms \\nout production of the garment to ensure that the delivery schedule is met. All of this is \\ndone to minimize production cost while meeting delivery schedules. Clearly Li & Fung \\nis an integrator that adds to the supply chain surplus in ways that no individual cus\\xad\\ntomer or supplier can. The firm aggregates demand across hundreds of customers, \\ncapacity across thousands of suppliers, and uses detailed information on both to match \\nsupply and demand in the most cost-effective manner. \\nAs supply chains become more global, 3PLs with a broad range of services are \\nenjoying an advantage in the market place. This has led to a series of mergers, with \\nlarge 3PLs getting even larger. With the increasing use of postponement, especially in \\nthe electronics industry, intermediaries are being asked to take on partial manufac\\xad\\nturing responsibilities. This has led to a blurring of the distinction between 3PLs and \\ncontract manufacturers. The larger 3PLs are increasingly trying to offer some form of \\nfinal assembly as part of their service. Contract manufacturers in turn are expanding \\ntheir logistics capabilities by either buying or partnering with logistics providers. For \\nexample, Celestica, a contract manufacturer, has partnered with Exel Logistics, \\nFedEx, Kuehne & Nagel, and Panalpina as its logistics providers. Another contract \\nmanufacturer, Flextronics bought a few logistics providers in the early 2000s.

Or consider suppliers that have different on-time performance. Is the more reliable supplier worth the few extra pennies it charges per piece? \\nIn each of the aforementioned instances, the price charged by the supplier is only one of many factors that affect the supply chain surplus. When scoring and assessing suppliers, the following factors other than quoted price must be considered: \\n• Replenishment lead time \\n• On- time performance \\n• Supply flexibility \\n• Delivery frequency/minimum lot size \\n• Supply quality \\n• Inbound transportation cost \\n• Pricing terms \\n• Information coordination capability \\n• Design collaboration capability \\n• Exchange rates, taxes, and duties \\n• Supplier viability \\nSupplier performance must be rated on each of these factors because they all affect the total supply chain cost. Next we discuss how each factor affects total supply \\nchain cost and how a supplier's rating on the factor can be used to infer a total cost of using the supplier. \\n1. Replenishment lead time. As the replenishment lead time from a supplier grows, the amount of safety inventory that needs to be held by the buyer also grows proportional to the square root of the replenishment lead time (see Chapter 11). Lead-time perfor\\xadmance by a supplier can be translated directly into the required safety inventory using Equation 11.9. Scoring the performance of suppliers in terms of replenishment lead time thus allows the firm to evaluate the impact each supplier has on the cost of hold\\xading safety inventory. \\n2. On-time performance. On-time performance affects the variability of the lead time. A reliable supplier has low variability of lead time, whereas an unreliable supplier has high variability. As the variability of lead time grows, the required safety inventory at the firm grows very rapidly (see Chapter 11). On-time performance can be translated into lead-time variability, which is converted to required safety inventory using Equation 11.11. A firm can use the discussion in Chapter 11 to evaluate the impact of poor on-time performance by a supplier on the cost of holding safety inventory. \\n3. Supply flexibility. Supply flexibility is the amount of variation in order quantity that a supplier can tolerate without letting other performance factors deteriorate. The less flexible a supplier is, the more lead-time variability it will display as order quantities \\nchange. Supply flexibility thus affects the level of safety inventory that the firm will have to carry. \\n4. Delivery frequency/minimum lot size. The delivery frequency and the minimum lot size offered by a supplier affect the size of each replenishment lot ordered by a firm. As the replenishment lot size grows, the cycle inventory at the firm grows, thus increasing the cost of holding inventory (see Chapter 10). Delivery frequency is converted to cycle inventory using Equation 10.1. For a firm using a periodic review policy, delivery frequency also affects the required safety inventory (see Equation 11.16). Thus, delivery frequency of a supplier can be converted into the cost of holding cycle and safe_ty inventory. \\n5. Supply quality. A worsening of supply quality increases the variability of the supply of components available to a firm. Quality affects the lead time taken by the supplier \\n----------~~\"),\n",

As a result, \\nthe firm has to carry more safety inventory (see Chapter 11) from a low-quality sup\\xad\\nplier compared to a high-quality supplier. Once a relationship among supply quality, \\nlead time, and lead time variability is established, each supplier's quality level can be \\nconverted to the required safety inventory and the associated holding cost. The com\\xad\\nponent quality also affects customer satisfaction and product cost because of rework, \\nlost material, and the cost of inspection. \\n6. Inbound transportation cost. The total cost of using a supplier includes the inbound \\ntransportation cost of bringing material in from the supplier. Sourcing a product over\\xad\\nseas may have lower product cost but generally incurs a higher inbound transportation \\ncost, which must be accounted for when comparing suppliers. The distance, mode of \\ntransportation, and delivery frequency affect the inbound transportation cost associ\\xad\\nated with each supplier. \\n7. Pricing terms. Pricing terms include the allowable time delay before payment has to \\nbe made and any quantity discounts offered by the supplier. Allowable time delays in \\npayment to suppliers save the buyer working capital. The cost of working capital sav\\xad\\nings for each supplier can be quantified. Price terms also include discounts for pur\\xad\\nchases above certain quantities. Quantity discounts lower the unit cost but tend to \\nincrease the required batch size and as a result the cycle inventory (see Chapter 10). As \\ndiscussed in Chapter 10, the impact of quantity discounts on material cost and inven\\xad\\ntory cost can be quantified for each supplier. \\n8. Information coordination capability. The information coordination capability of \\na supplier is harder to quantify, but it affects the ability of a firm to match supply and \\ndemand. Good coordination results in better replenishment planning, thus decreasing \\nboth the inventory carried as well as the sales lost because of lack of availability. Good \\ninformation coordination also decreases the bullwhip effect (see Chapter 17) and \\nresults in lower production, inventory, and transportation costs while improving \\nresponsiveness to the customer. The value of better coordination is linked to the \\namount of variability introduced into the supply chain as a result of the bullwhip effect. \\n9. Design collaboration capability. Given that a large part of product cost is fixed at \\ndesign, collaboration capability of a supplier is significant. Good design collabora\\xad\\ntion for manufacturability and supply chain can also decrease required inventories \\nand transportation cost. As manufacturers are increasingly outsourcing both the \\ndesign and manufacture of components, their ability to coordinate design across \\nmany_suppliers is critical to the ultimate success of the product and the speed of \\nintroduction. As a result, design collaboration capability of suppliers is becoming \\nincreasingly important. \\n10. Exchange rates, taxes, and duties. Although exchange rates, taxes, and duties are \\nnot supplier dependent, they can be significant for a firm with a global manufacturing \\nand supply base. In many instances, currency fluctuations affect component price more \\nthan all other factors put together. Financial hedges can be put into place to counter \\nexchange-rate fluctuations. It is important, however, to analyze various supply options \\nin a global supply chain to account for demand and macroeconomic variability, as dis\\xad\\ncussed in Chapter 6. Similarly, the level of taxes and duties can make a significant dif\\xad\\nference on total cost, depending on the location of the supplier. \\n11. Supplier viability. Given the impact that suppliers have on a company's perfor\\xad\\nmance, an important factor in picking a supplier is the likelihood that it will be around \\nto fulfill the promises it makes. This consideration can be especially important if the \\nsupplier is providing mission -critical products and it would be difficult to find a\"),\n",

Taking all performance characteristics into account, the purchasing manager \\nshould continue to use the current supplier. \\n14.5 SUPPLIER SELECTION-AUCTIONS \\nAND NEGOTIATIONS \\nBefore selecting suppliers, a firm must decide whether to use single sourcing or multi\\xad\\nple suppliers. Single sourcing guarantees the supplier sufficient business when the \\nsupplier has to make a significant buyer-specific investment. The buyer-specific \\ninvestment may take the form of plant and equipment designed to produce a part that \\nis specific to the buyer or may take the form of expertise that needs to be developed. \\nSingle sourcing is also used in the automotive industry for parts such as seats that \\nmust arrive in the sequence of production. Coordinating such sequencing is impossi\\xad\\nble with multiple sources. As a result, auto companies have a single seat source for \\neach plant but multiple seat sources across their manufacturing network. Having mul\\xad\\ntiple sources ensures a degree of competition and also the possibility of a backup \\nshould a source fail to deliver. \\nA good test of whether a firm has the right number of suppliers is to analyze what \\nimpact deleting or adding a supplier will have. Unless each supplier has a somewhat \\ndifferent role, it is very likely that the supply base is too large. In contrast, unless adding \\na supplier with a unique and valuable capability clearly adds to total cost, the supply \\nbase may be too small. \\nThe selection of suppliers is done using a variety of mechanisms, including offline \\ncompetitive bids, reverse auctions, or direct negotiations. No matter what mechanism is \\nused, supplier selection should be based on the total cost of using a supplier and not \\njust the purchase price. Next we discuss some auction mechanisms that are often used \\nin practice and highlight some of their properties.\"),\n",

Competitive bids are a form of \\nauction in which the bids are not revealed to the other bidders. In the following discussion \\nwe treat them as auctions. An excellent discussion on auctions can be found in Krishna \\n(2002) and Milgram (2004). Much of the following discussion is a summary of their ideas. \\nIn many supply chain settings, a buyer looks to outsource a supply chain function \\nsuch as production or transportation. Potential suppliers are first qualified and then \\nallowed to bid on how much they would charge to perform the function. The qualifica\\xad\\ntion process is important because there are multiple attributes of performance (as out\\xad\\nlined in Table 14-3) that the buyer cares about. When conducting an auction based \\nprimarily on unit price, it is thus important for the buyer to specify performance expec\\xad\\ntations along all dimensions other than price. In reality a buyer may be better off with a \\nmultiattribute auction, but in most cases buyers end up with specifications on various \\nattributes and a price-only auction. The qualification process is used to identify suppli\\xad\\ners that meet performance expectations along the nonprice attributes. From the buyer's \\nperspective, the purpose of the auction is to get bidders to reveal their underlying cost \\nstructure so that the buyer can select the supplier with the lowest costs. Commonly used \\nmechanisms for these auctions are as follows. \\n• Sealed-bid first-price auctions require each potential supplier to submit a sealed \\nbid for the contract by a specified time. These bids are then opened and the con\\xad\\ntract is assigned to the lowest bidder. \\n• In English auctions, the auctioneer starts with a price and suppliers can make bids \\nas long as each successive bid is lower than the previous bid. The supplier with \\nthe last (lowest) bid receives the contract. The difference in this case is that all \\nsuppliers get to see the current lowest bid as the aucti?n unfolds. \\n• In Dutch auctions, the auctioneer starts with a low price and then raises it slowly \\nuntil one of the suppliers agrees to the contract at that price. \\n• In second-price (Vickrey) auctions, each potential supplier submits a bid. The contract \\nis assigned to the lowest bidder but at the price quoted by the second-lowest bidder. \\nWhen identifying the auction to use, the firm wants to minimize the price it pays. The \\nfirm may also care about ending up with the supplier with the lowest underlying costs \\nbecause it makes it more likely that the supplier will actually be able to supply at the price \\nit has committed to. A related issue is whether suppliers have any incentive to make false \\nbids that are_not consistent with their cost structure. Such bids may increase what the firm \\npays and also lead to the contract being given to a firm that does not have the lowest costs. \\nAn important issue with the sealed-bid first-price auction is what is known as the \\nwinner's curse. Once selected based on sealed bids, the winner quickly realizes that it \\ncould have raised its bid slightly and still won, because other suppliers bid at a higher \\nlevel. In this sense, winning the bid leads the winner to realize that it left money on the \\ntable. Thus, bidders adjust their initial sealed bids upward, taking this phenomenon \\ninto account. This issue does not arise in any open auction, where bidders see the cur\\xad\\nrent best bid when planning their next bid. This issue also does not arise in the second\\xad\\nprice auction because the winner gets the price quoted by the second-lowest bidder \\nand thus has no incentive to hide its true cost. \\nThe following factors influence the performance of an auction: \\n• Is the supplier's cost structure private (not affected by factors that are common to \\nother bidders)? \\n• Are suppliers symmetric or not, that is, ex ante, are they expected to have similar \\ncost structures?\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat 10.0 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'PdfCompressor 3.1.34', 'creationdate': 'D:2010m`ûà\\x85Ã\\x87EôÄéÒ\\x87¾i\\x00õ\\x1aX\\x84\\x8ac\\x8f^¸c×jþ~õça}`\\x8c\\x07£&\\x82êk\\x15Ë1¡©', 'creationdate--text': 'D:2010m`ÇE҇i', 'moddate': '2010-12-08T21:52:11+04:00', 'source': 'D:\\\\KGP Notes\\\\6th Sem\\\\Information Systems Project\\\\Logistics-and-Supply-Chain-Management-Sunil-Chopra-1.pdf', 'total_pages': 543, 'page': 439, 'page_label': '440'}, page_content=\"434 PART VI + Managing Cross-Functional Drivers in a Supply Chain \\n• Do suppliers have all the information they need to estimate their cost structure? \\n• Does the buyer specify a maximum price it is willing to pay for the supply \\nchain? \\nLet us start with the cost structures for suppliers. In most instances it is reasonable \\nto assume that part of the supplier's cost arises from how it has structured its processes \\nand part of its cost arises from market factors such as raw material and labor cost that \\nare common across suppliers. In other words, the suppliers' cost structure is likely to be \\ninterdependent and correlated to some extent. This interdependence and correlation is \\nlikely to be higher for suppliers with similar processes located in similar markets. If \\nsuppliers are symmetric with costs that are interdependent and correlated, the \\nexpected price that a firm has to pay using an English auction is no more than that in a \\nsecond-price auction, which is no more than in a sealed-bid first-price auction. In other \\nwords, under these conditions the English auction is likely to fetch the lowest price for \\nthe firm. If suppliers are asymmetric, however, it is possible that a second-price auction \\nmay do better than an English auction. \\nIf the buyer firm has some information that has a direct bearing on suppliers' \\ncosts and the suppliers are aware that the firm has this information but do not know \\nthe information itself, it is in the best interest of the firm to reveal this information. \\nUnder all auction mechanisms (with symmetric bidders), the buyer pays less with all \\ninformation revealed than with less information revealed. Thus, it is in the best inter\\xad\\nest of the buyer to specify its needs clearly and reveal all information related to the \\nsupply chain task of which it is aware. Not revealing this information leads the bidders \\nto shade their bids to guard against the winner's curse, resulting in an increase in the \\nprice paid by the buyer. Thus, it is in the buyer's interest not only to reveal all public \\ninformation before bidding but also to convince potential suppliers that all informa\\xad\\ntion has been revealed. \\nA very significant factor that must be accounted for when designing an auction is the \\npossibility of collusion among bidders. Second-price auctions are particularly vulnerable \\nto collusion among bidders. Consider an agreement among bidders under which the bid\\xad\\nder with the lowest cost agrees to bid its true cost, with all other bidders bidding a high \\nnumber (say, the cost of the most expensive bidder or the reserve price of the buyer). In \\na second-price auction, the lowest-cost bidder gets to perform the supply chain function \\nbut the buyer has to a pay a higher price than the cost of the second-lowest-cost supplier. \\nThis collusion strategy is an equilibrium because none of the other bidders has anything \\nto gain by deviating from the collusion agreement. Observe that this collusion strategy \\ncan be· avoided with any first-price auction, either sealed bid or English. In either case, a \\ncollusion agreement with a very high price will not hold, because many bidders will have \\nthe temptation to join the bidding if they have a lower cost. Ultimately, any first-price \\nauction will bring more than the lowest-cost bidder in to the auction. \\nCollusion results in suppliers suppressing their desire to provide the supply chain \\nfunction and raising their bids from what would be appropriate given their cost. This is \\noften the case in multiunit auctions, in which the buyer wants suppliers to bid on a cer\\xad\\ntain quantity of the supply chain function. In multiunit Dutch auctions, the buyer starts \\nby announcing a high price and then lowers it slowly until a supplier is willing to pro\\xad\\nvide one unit of the goods or services. The price is lowered slowly until suppliers have \\ncommitted to all units of goods or services desired by the buyer. In this auction, each \\nunit is supplied at a different price. In a multiunit English auction, the buyer starts at a \\nhigh price and bidders announce the quantity they are willing to supply. If the total \\nquantity that suppliers are willing to supply exceeds the desired quantity, the buyer \\nlowers the price until the quantity for which suppliers bid equals the desired quantity.\"),\n",

This auction is also referred to as the uniform-price auction. Suppliers in either auction can raise the final price by colluding and forming a bidding ring that assigns only one bidder to enter the auction process for the entire ring. After the initial auction the ring then has a separate auction to divide up the quantity they have been assigned among themselves. An excellent discussion on collusion can be found in Porter (2004). \\nBASIC PRINCIPLES OF NEGOTIATION \\nIn some instances, the third party that will perform a given supply chain function has been identified and the firm enters into a negotiation to set the terms of the contract. Negotiation is likely to result in a positive outcome only if the value the buyer places on outsourcing the supply chain function to this supplier is at least as large as the value the supplier places on performing the function for the buyer. The value that a supplier places on performing a function is influenced by its cost as well as other alternatives that are available for its existing capacity. Similarly, the value that the buyer places is influenced by the cost of performing the function in-house and the price available from alternative suppliers. The difference between the values of the buyer and seller is referred to as the bargaining surplus. The goal of each negotiating party is to capture as much of the bargaining surplus as possible. \\nAn excellent discussion on negotiations is available in Thompson (2005). We men\\xadtion some of the highlights from her discussion. The first recommendation is to have a clear idea of your own value and as good an estimate of the third party\\'s value as pos\\xadsible. A good estimate of the bargaining surplus improves the chance of a successful outcome. Suppliers of Toyota have often mentioned that \"Toyota knows our costs bet\\xadter than we do,\" which leads to better negotiations. The second recommendation is to look for a fair outcome based on equally or equitably dividing the bargaining surplus or dividing it based on needs. Equity here refers to a division of the surplus in propor\\xadtion to the contribution by each party. \\nThe key to a successful negotiation, however, is to make it a win-win outcome. It is impossible to obtain a win-win outcome if the two parties are negotiating on a sin\\xadgle dimension such as price. In this setting, one party can only \"win\" at the expense of the other. To create a win-win negotiation, the two parties have to identify more than one issue to negotiate. Identifying multiple issues allows the opportunity to expand the pie if the two parties have different preferences. This is often easier than it seems in a supply chain setting. A buyer typically cares not just about the price of perform\\xading the supply chain function but also about the responsiveness and quality (two of the dimensions identified in Table 14-3).

In \\naddition to making the terms of the buyer-supplier relationship explicit, contracts have \\nsignificant impact on the behavior and performance of all stages in a supply chain. \\nContracts should be designed to facilitate desirable supply chain outcomes and mini\\xad\\nmize actions that hurt performance. A manager should ask the following three ques\\xad\\ntions when designing a supply chain contract: \\n1. How will the contract affect the firm's profits and total supply chain profits? \\n2. Will the incentives in the contract introduce any information distortion? \\n3. How will the contract influence supplier performance along key performance \\nmeasures? \\nIdeally, a contract should be structured to increase the firm's profits and supply \\nchain profits, discourage information distortion, and offer incentives to the supplier to \\nimprove performance along key dimensions. Many shortcomings in supply chain per\\xad\\nformance occur because the buyer and supplier are two different entities, each trying to \\noptimize its own profits. \\nCONTRACTS FOR PRODUCT AVAILABILITY \\nAND SUPPLY CHAIN PROFITS \\nActions taken by the two parties in the supply chain often result in profits that are \\nlower than what could be achieved if the supply chain were to coordinate its actions \\nwith a common objective of maximizing supply chain profits. Consider a product \\nwhose demand is significantly affected by the retail price. The retailer decides its price \\n(and thus sales quantity) based on its margin. The retailer's margin is only a fraction of \\nthe supply chain margin, leading to a retail price that is higher than optimal and a sales \\nquantity that is lower than optimal for the supply chain. This phenomenon is referred \\nto as double marginalization (see Chapter 10). As discussed in Chapter 10, the supplier \\ncan increase supply chain profits by offering a volume discount, where the retailer pays \\na lower price if the total quantity purchased exceeds a threshold. \\nAnother example of double marginalization arises in the presence of demand \\nuncertainty. A manufacturer wants the retailer to carry a large inventory of its product to \\nensure that any surge in demand can be satisfied. The retailer, on the other hand, loses \\nmoney on any unsold inventory. As a result, the retailer prefers to carry a lower level of \\ninventory. This tension leads to a supply chain outcome that is suboptimal. \\nIn a contract in which the supplier specifies a fixed price and the buyer decides on \\nthe quantity to be purchased, the most common cause for suboptimal supply chain per\\xad\\nformance is double marginalization. The retailer makes its buying decision before \\ndemand is realized and thus bears all the demand uncertainty. If demand is less than the \\nretailer's inventory, the retailer has to liquidate unsold product at a discount. Given \\nuncertain demand, the retailer decides on the purchase quantity based on its margin \\nand the cost of overstocking. The retailer's margin, however, is lower than the contri\\xad\\nbution margin for the entire supply chain, whereas its cost of overstocking is higher \\nthan that for the entire supply chain. As a result, the retailer is conservative and aims \\nfor a lower level of product availability than is optimal for the supply chain. \\nConsider a music store that sells compact discs. The supplier buys (or manufac\\xad\\ntures) compact discs at $1 per unit and sells them to the music store at $5 per unit. The \\nretailer sells each disc to the end consumer at $10. At this retail price, market demand \\nis normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300. The\"),\n",

From Equation 12.3, the retailer's expected profits are $3,803 and the \\nmanufacturer makes $4,000 from selling 1,000 discs. For the supply chain, however, the \\nsupplier and the retailer together have a margin of $9 and can lose a maximum of only \\n$1 per unsold disc. For the entire supply chain it is thus optimal to aim for a service \\nlevel of 0.9 and stock 1,384 discs. The expected supply chain profit in this case is $8,474. \\nThe music store is thus conservative and carries fewer discs than are optimal for the \\nsupply chain. As a result, the supply chain makes $670 less than it would expect to if the \\nretailer and the supplier worked together. \\nTo improve overall profits, the supplier must design a contract that encourages the \\nbuyer to purchase more and increase the level of product availability. This requires the \\nsupplier to share in some of the buyer's demand uncertainty. Three contracts that \\nincrease overall profits by making the supplier share some of the buyer's demand \\nuncertainty are as follows: \\n1. Buyback or returns contracts \\n2. Revenue-sharing contracts \\n3. Quantity flexibility contracts \\nWe illustrate each of the three contracts using the example of the music store and \\ndiscuss their performance in terms of the three questions raised earlier. \\nBuyback Contracts \\nA buy-back or returns clause in a contract allows a retailer to return unsold inventory \\nup to a specified amount, at an agreed-upon price. In a buy-back contract, the manu\\xad\\nfacturer specifies a wholesale price c along with a buy-back price b at which the retailer \\ncan return any unsold units at the end of the season. The manufacturer can salvage $sM \\nfor any units that the retailer returns. \\nThe optimal order quantity o* for a retailer in response to a buy-back contract is \\nevaluated using Equations 12.1 and 12.2, where the salvage value for the retailer is \\ns = b. The expected retailer profit is evaluated using Equation 12.3. The expected \\nprofit at the manufacturer depends on the overstock at the retailer (evaluated using \\nEquation 12.4) that is returned. We obtain \\nExpected manufacturer profit = O*(c - v) - (b - sM) \\nX expected overstock at retailer \\nFor example, the supplier to the music store may agree to buy back discs that have \\nnot sold at $3 per disc. This lowers the loss to the retailer for each unsold disc from $5 \\nto $2. The supplier absorbs the $3 per unsold disc as a reduction in margin. The pres\\xad\\nence of the buy-back clause makes it optimal for the retailer to increase the order size \\nfrom 1,000 to 1,170, resulting in higher product availability and higher profits for both \\nthe retailer ($4,286 instead of $3,803) and the supplier ($4,009 instead of $4,000). Buy\\xad\\nback contracts are most effective for products with a low variable cost. Examples \\ninclude music, software, books, magazines, and newspapers. \\nTable 14-4 provides the outcome for different buy-back contracts that the supplier \\noffers the music store. The sale price of compact discs at the music store is p = $10 and \\ndemand at.thisprice is normally distributed, with a mean of fL = 1,000 and a standard \\ndeviation of () = 300. At this stage we assume that there is no transportation or other \\ncost associated with any returns. \\nFrom Table 14-4, observe that a buy-back contract allows both the supplier and \\nthe retailer to increase their profits.

Observe that as the wholesale price increases, it is optimal for the manufac\\xad\\nturer to increase the buy-back price as well. For a fixed wholesale price, as the buy\\xad\\nback price increases, the retailer orders more and also returns more. In our analysis in \\nTable 14-4, we have not considered the cost associated with a return. As the cost asso\\xad\\nciated with a return increases, buy-back contracts become less attractive because the \\ncost of returns reduces supply chain profits. If return costs are very high, buy-back \\ncontracts can reduce the total profits of the supply chain far more than is the case \\nwithout any buyback. \\nFor a fixed wholesale price, increasing the buy-back price always increases \\nretailer profits. In general, there exists a positive buy-back price that is a fraction of \\nthe wholesale price, at which the manufacturer makes a higher profit compared to \\noffering no buyback. Also observe that buybacks increase profits for the manufacturer \\nmore as the manufacturer's margin increases. Thus, the greater the manufacturer's \\nmargin, the more they stand to benefit through the use of some mechanism such as \\nbuybacks. \\nIn 1932, Viking Press was the first book publisher to accept returns. Today, buy\\xad\\nback contracts are very common in the book industry, and publishers accept unsold \\nbooks from retailers. To minimize the cost associated with a return, retailers do not \\nhave to return the book, only the cover. This provides publishers with proof that the \\nbook did not sell while reducing the cost of the return. Over the years, there has been \\nconsiderable debate about the impact of publishers' returns policy on profits in the \\nindustry. Our discussion provides some justification for the approach taken by the \\npublishers. \\nKE~/P(}I~! .... ·····~aQGtacturersC~ntJ~e •. buy-b~ck:contractsto .increasetheir oV\\\\/nprofits \\n.as \\\\N~IIastoi~l s.Uf:>81Y chain ...

Many manufacturers guar\\xad\\nantee that in the event they drop prices, they will also lower prices for all inventories \\nthat the retailer is currently carrying. As a result, the cost of overstocking at the retailer \\nis limited to the cost of capital and physical storage and does not include obsolescence, \\nwhich can be over 100 percent a year for high-tech products. The retailer thus increases \\nthe level of product availability in the presence of price support. Both holding-cost \\nsubsidies and price support are forms of buyback. \\nA downside to the buy-back clause (or any equivalent practice such as holding\\xad\\ncost subsidy or price support) is that it leads to surplus inventory that must be salvaged \\nor disposed. The task of returning unsold product increases supply chain costs. The cost \\nof returns can be eliminated if the manufacturer gives the retailer a markdown \\nallowance and allows it to sell the product at a significant discount. Publishers today \\ngenerally do not ask retailers to return unsold books. Instead, they give a markdown \\nallowance for unsold books. Retailers mark them down and sell them for a consider\\xad\\nable discount. \\nFor a given level of product availability at the retailer, the presence of a buy-back \\nclause can also hurt sales because itleads the retailer to exert less effort to sell than it \\nwould if there were no buybacks. The reduction in retailer effort in the presence of \\nbuyback occurs because its loss from unsold inventory is higher when there is no buy\\xad\\nback, leading to a higher sales effort. The supplier can counter the reduction in sales \\neffort by limiting the amount of buyback permitted. \\nThe structure of a buy-back clause leads to the entire supply chain reacting to the \\norder placed by the retailer and not actual customer demand. If a supplier is selling to \\nmultiple retailers, it produces based on the orders placed by each retailer. Each retailer \\nbases its order on its cost of over- and understacking (see Chapter 12). After actual \\nsales materialize, unsold inventory is returned to the supplier separately from each \\nretailer. The structure of the buy-back clause increases information distortion when a \\nsupplier is selling to multiple retailers. At the end of the sales season, however, the sup\\xad\\nplier does obtain information on actual sales. Information distortion is driven primarily \\nby the fact that inventory is disaggregated at the retailers. If inventory is centralized at \\nthe supplier and sent out only as needed to the retailers, information distortion can be \\nreduced. With centralized inventory, the supplier can exploit independence of demand \\nacross retailers to carry a lower level of inventory. In practice, most buy-back contracts, \\nhowever, have decentralized inventory at retailers. As a result, there is a high level of \\ninformation distortion. \\nKEY POINT Buy-back contracts lead to a lower retailer effort in case of overstocking \\nahd increased inforrnati8n distortion withih the supply chain. \\nRevenue-Sharing Contracts \\nIn revenue-sharing contracts, the manufacturer charges the retailer a low wholesale \\nprice c, and shares a fraction f of the retailer's revenue. Even if no returns are allowed, \\nthe lower wholesale price decreases the cost to the retailer in case of an overstock. The \\nretailer thus increases the level of product availability resulting in higher profits for \\nboth the manufacturer and the retailer. \\nAssume that the manufacturer has a production cost v; the retailer charges a retail \\nprice p and can salvage any leftover units for sR.

The music store targets a service level of 81.8 \\npercent (see Equation 12.1) and increases the number of discs they order from 1,000 \\n(when the supplier priced at $5 without revenue sharing) to 1,273. The increase in \\norder size occurs because the retailer loses only $1 per unsold disc (instead of $5 per \\ndisc without revenue sharing), while making a margin of $4.5 for each disc that sells.

As a result of revenue sharing, the retailer increases the quantity \\nordered from 1,000 to 1,273. \\nRevenue-sharing contracts also result in lower retailer effort compared to the case \\nwhen the retailer pays an up-front wholesale price and keeps the entire revenue from \\na sale. The drop in effort results because the retailer gets only a fraction of the revenue \\nfrom each sale. One advantage of revenue-sharing contracts over buy-back contracts is \\nthat no product needs to be returned, thus eliminating the cost of returns. Revenue\\xad\\nsharing contracts are best suited for products with low variable cost and a high cost of \\nreturn. A good example of revenue-sharing contracts is between Blockbuster video \\nrentals and movie studios. A studio sells each cassette to Blockbuster at a low price and \\nthen shares in the revenue generated from each rental. Given the low price, Blockbuster \\npurchases many copies, resulting in more rentals and higher profits for both Blockbuster \\nand the studio. \\nThe revenue-sharing contract does require an information infrastructure that \\nallows the supplier to monitor sales at the retailer. Such an infrastructure can be \\nexpensive to build. As a result, revenue-sharing contracts may be difficult to manage \\nfor a supplier selling to many small buyers. · \\nAs in buy-back contracts, revenue-sharing contracts also result in the supply chain \\nproducing to retailer orders rather than actual consumer demand. This information \\ndistortion results in excess inventory in the supply chain and a greater mismatch of \\nsupply and demand. The information distortion increases as the number of retailers to \\nwhich the supplier sells grows. As with buy-back contracts, information distortion \\nfrom revenue-sharing contracts can be reduced if retailers reserve production capac\\xad\\nity or inventory at the supplier rather than buying product and holding it in inventory \\nthemselves. This allows aggregation of the variability across multiple retailers and the \\nsupplier has to hold a lower level of capacity or inventory. In practice, however, most \\nrevenue-sharing contracts are implemented with the retailer buying and holding \\ninventory. \\nv KEY F>(>IN~ 'HevEmul:~harrH~;c:o~t~~~t~ 6ount~r doUbJ~ m~rginan~atipn' 8y;§ecreas~· \\n:·· ·. i ~g the.c.ostper·.unitc~arg e~ t,p·tn~·ret~ile,r:'th~.~ •. ,~~~?:~iveiSI decr~asingi the, c;o~t of over~ \\n·•· .. ···. stocking .• ~eve~u.e-'sh~ri~g·sontra.ct~insr~~se[nfo,rrna~ior ~i$t()rtip~ .and r~adto a lower retailer.effortin .case of overstockirtg, jU~t as buy~back cOntracts do. .. . \\nQuantity Flexibility Contracts \\nUnder quantity flexibility contracts, the manufacturer allows the retailer to change the \\nquantity ordered after observing demand.

In the previous discussion, we considered fairly simple quantity flexibility contracts. Benetton has used sophisticated quantity flexibility contracts with its retailers successfully to increase supply chain profits. We describe such a contract in the context of colored knit garments.2 \\nSeven months before deliVery, Benetton retailers are required to place their orders. Consider a retailer placing an order for 100 sweaters each in red, blue, and yel\\xadlow. One to three months before delivery, retailers may alter up to 30 percent of the quantity ordered in any color and assign it to another color. The aggregate order, how\\xadever, cannot be adjusted at this stage. Potentially the retailer may change the order to 70 red, 70 blue, and 160 yellow sweaters. After the start of the sales season, retailers are allowed to order up to 10 percent of their previous order in any color. Potentially the retailer can order another 30 yellow sweaters. In this quantity flexibility contract, Benetton retailers have a flexibility of up to 10 percent on the aggregate order across all colors and of about 40 percent for individual colors. Retailers can increase the aggregate quantity ordered by up to 10 percent and the quantity for any individual color can be adjusted by up to 40 percent. This flexibility is consistent with the fact that aggregate forecasts are more accurate than forecasts for individual colors. As a result, retailers can better match product availability with demand. The guaranteed portion of the order is manufactured by Benetton using an inexpensive but long-lead-time pro\\xadduction process. The flexible part of the order (about 35 percent) is manufactured using postponement. The result is a better matching of supply and demand at lower cost than in the absence of such a contract. The quantity flexibility contract Benetton offers allows both the retailers and Benetton to increase their profits. \\nIf the supplier has flexible capacity, a quantity flexibility contract increases profits for the entire supply chain and also each party. The quantity flexibility contract requires either inventory or excess flexible capacity to be available at the supplier. If the supplier is selling to multiple retailers with independent demand, the aggregation of inventory leads to a smaller surplus inventory (see Chapter 11) with a quantity flexibility contract compared to either a buy-back or revenue-sharing contract. Inventories can be further reduced if the supplier has excess flexible capacity. Quantity flexibility contracts are thus preferred for products with high marginal cost or in instances where surplus capacity is available. To be effective, quantity flexibility contracts require the retailer to be good at gathering m'!rket intelligence and improving its forecasts closer to the point of sale. Relative to buy-back and revenue-sharing contracts, quantity flexibility contracts have less information distortion. Consider the case with multiple retailers. With a buy\\xadback contract, the supply chain must produce based on the retailer orders that are placed well before actual demand arises. This leads to surplus inventory being disag\\xadgregated at each retailer. With a quantity flexibility contract, retailers specify only the range within which they will purchase, well before actual demand arises. If demand at various retailers is independent, the supplier does not need to plan production to the high end of the order range for each retailer. It can aggregate uncertainty across all retailers and build a lower level of surplus inventory than would be needed if inventory were disaggregated at each retailer. Retailers then order closer to the point of sale, when demand is more visible and less uncertain. The aggregation of uncertainty results in less information distortion with a quantity flexibility contract. \\n2See Heskett and Signorelli (1984).\"),\n",

An example is the replenishment lot size decision typically made by \\nthe buyer. The buyer decides on its optimal lot size based on its fixed cost per lot and the \\ncost of holding inventory. The buyer does not account for the supplier's costs. If the sup\\xad\\nplier has a high fixed cost per lot, the optimal lot size for the buyer increases total cost \\nfor the supplier and the supply chain. In such a situation, the supplier can use a quantity \\ndiscount contract to encourage the buyer to order in lot sizes that minimize total costs \\n(see Chapter 10). The objective of such a contract is to encourage the retailer to buy in \\nlarger lot sizes that lower cost for the supplier and the entire supply chain. \\nA quantity discount contract decreases overall costs but leads to higher lot sizes \\nand thus higher levels of inventory in the supply chain. It is typically justified only for \\ncommodity products for which the supplier has high fixed costs per lot. It is important \\nto modify the terms of the contract as operational improvements are made at the sup\\xad\\nplier, resulting in lower fixed costs per batch. \\nQuantity discounts increase information distortion in the supply chain because \\nsuch con tracts increase order batching. Retailers order less frequently, and any \\ndemand variations are exaggerated when orders are placed. The supplier receives \\ninformation less frequently and all variations are increased because of this batching. \\nThis information distortion is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 17. \\n· ~~p(jiNt· 'qbaf1ti~~~~cbu9ts b€o;eo?r~in~t~slippiQ·9h'~rf1 §C>~ts·)fthesupplier has \\n> ~~~~fi~ecJ'9~sts.~~rt§t:au~~titydis.~?LJrite>,.9owe~~r,•.iQcr:~se.infor,matio~distortionas \\n·:·~ ~T;s~H ·ot ar~erbat.cbhlltl· · · ··· . · · · · . · · . · ·.. · · · . . . \\nCONTRACTS TO INCREASE AGENT EFFORT \\nIn many supply chains, agents act on behalf of a principal and the agents' effort affects \\nthe reward for the principal. As an example, consider a car dealer (the agent) selling \\ncars for DaimlerChrysler (the principal). The dealer also sells other brands and used \\ncars. Every month the dealer allocates its sales effort (advertising, promotions, etc.) \\nacross all brands it sells and the used cars. Earnings for DaimlerChrysler are based on \\nsales of its brands, which in turn are affected by the effort exerted by the dealer. Sales \\ncan be observed directly, whereas effort is hard to observe and measure. Given double \\nmarginalization, the dealer always exerts less effort thari is optimal from the perspective \\nof DaimlerChrysler and the supply chain. Thus, DaimlerChrysler must offer an incen\\xad\\ntive contract that encourages the dealer to increase effort. \\n··~\"),\n",

In a two-part tariff, DaimlerChrysler extracts its profits \\nup front as a franchise fee and then sells cars to the dealer at cost. The dealer's margin \\nis then the same as the supply chain margin, and the dealer exerts the right amount of \\neffort. \\nAnother contract, observed more frequently in practice, increases the margin for \\nthe dealer as sales cross certain thresholds. DaimlerChrysler offered such a contract \\nto dealers in the first quarter of 2001, which was structured roughly as follows. \\nDealers would keep the margin made from customers if sales for the month were \\nunder 75 percent of an agreed-upon target. However, if sales exceeded 75 percent but \\nwere less than 100 percent, the dealer would get an additional $150 per car sold. If \\nsales exceeded 100 percent but were less than 110 percent, the dealer would get an \\nadditional $250 per car sold. If sales exceeded 110 percent, the dealer would get an addi\\xad\\ntional $500 per car sold. DaimlerChrysler's hope was that by increasing the margin for \\nhigher thresholds, the dealer would have an incentive to increase effort on sales of \\nDaimlerChrysler cars. \\nAlthough threshold contracts clearly encourage the dealer to try and reach higher \\nthresholds, they can significantly increase information distortion by encouraging the \\nagent to exacerbate demand variability. The first month after the new contract was \\nannounced, the U.S. car industry saw sales drop. DaimlerChrysler, however, saw sales \\ndrop by twice the industry average. There are two potential causes for this behavior. \\nFirst, under the contract, the dealer makes more money selling 900 cars one month and \\n1,100 the next month compared to selling a thousand cars each month. The dealer has \\nan incentive to shift demand over time to achieve such an outcome, thus increasing \\ninformation distortion and observed demand variation. The second cause is that within \\nthe first week of the month the dealer has an idea of the threshold range it is likely to \\nreach. For example, if the dealer feels that it can easily cross the 75 percent threshold \\nbut has little chance of crossing the 100 percent threshold, it will decrease his effort for \\nthe month and save it for later, because the marginal benefit of selling an additional car \\nis only $150. In contrast, if demand for the month is high and the dealer feels it can eas\\xad\\nily cross the 100 percent threshold, it is likely to exert additional effort to reach the 110 \\npercent threshold because the marginal benefit from reaching that threshold is very \\nhigh. Thus, DaimlerChrysler's incentive contract increases variation in dealer effort, \\nfurther exaggerating any existing demand variation. \\nInformation distortion is also observed in threshold contracts often offered by \\ncompanies to their sales staff. Under these contracts, staff is offered rewards for cross\\xad\\ning sales thresholds during a specified period of time (e.g., a quarter). The problem \\nobserved is that sales effort and orders peak during the last week or two of the quarter, \\nas salespeople try to cross the threshold. Observed sales are thus highly uneven during \\nthe quarter. This information distortion arises because the incentive is offered over a \\nfixed time period, making the last week or two of each quarter a period of intense \\nactivity for all sales staff. \\nGiven the information distortion arising from threshold contracts, a key ques\\xad\\ntion is how a firm can decrease information distortion while maintaining the incen\\xad\\ntive for the agent to exert extra effort. One approach is to offer threshold incentives \\nover a rolling horizon. For example, if a firm offers its sales staff weekly incentives \\nbased on sales over the last 13 weeks, each week becomes the last week of a 13-week \\nperiod. Sales effort thus becomes more even compared to the case when the entire \\nsales staff has the same last week for their bonus evaluation. Given the presence of \\nERP systems, implementing a rolling horizon contract is much easier today than it \\nonce was. \\n---~---~\"),\n",

Threshold contracts, how\\xad\\never, increase information distortion and are best implemented on a rolling horizon. \\nCONTRACTSTOINDUCEPERFORMANCEIMPROVEMENT \\nIn many instances a buyer wants performance improvement from a supplier that has \\nlittle incentive to do so. A buyer with sufficient power in the supply chain may be able \\nto force the supplier to comply. A buyer without sufficient power requires an appropri\\xad\\nate contract to induce the supplier to improve performance. Even for a powerful \\nbuyer, however, an appropriate contract designed to encourage supplier cooperation \\nresults in a better outcome. \\nAs an example, consider a buyer that wants the supplier to improve performance by \\nreducing lead time for a seasonal item. This is an important component of all quick \\nresponse (QR) initiatives in a supply chain. With a shorter lead time, the buyer hopes to \\nhave better forecasts and be better able to match supply and demand. Most of the work \\nto reduce lead time has to be done by the supplier, whereas most of the benefit accrues \\nto the buyer. In fact, the supplier will lose sales because the buyer will now carry less \\nsafety inventory because of shorter lead times and better forecasts. To induce the sup\\xad\\nplier to reduce lead time, the buyer can use a shared-savings contract, with the supplier \\ngetting a fraction of the savings that result from reducing lead time. As long as the sup\\xad\\nplier\\'s share of the savings compensates for any effort it has to put in, its incentive will \\nbe aligned with that of the buyer, resulting in an outcome that benefits both parties. \\nA similar issue arises when a buyer wants to encourage the supplier to improve \\nquality. Improving supply quality improves the buyer\\'s costs but requires additional \\neffort from the supplier. Once again, a shared-savings contract is a good way to align \\nincentives between the buyer and supplier. The buyer can share savings from improved \\nquality with the supplier. This will encourage the supplier to improve quality to a \\nhigher level than what the supplier would choose in the absence of the shared savings. \\nAnother example arises in the context of toxic chemicals that may be used by a man\\xad\\nufacturer. The manufacturer would like to decrease the use of these toxic chemicals. \\nGenerally, the supplier is better equipped to identify ways of reducing use of these chem\\xad\\nicals because this is its core business. It has no incentive to work with the buyer on reduc\\xad\\ning use of these chemicals because that will reduce the supplier\\'s sales. A shared-savings \\ncontract can be used to align incentives between the supplier and the manufacturer. If \\nthe manufacturer shares the savings that result from a reduction in the use of toxic chem\\xad\\nicals with the supplier, the supplier will make the effort to reduce use of the chemicals as \\nlong as its share of the savings compensates for the loss in margin from reduced sales. \\nIn general, shared-savings contracts are effective in aligning supplier and buyer incen\\xad\\ntives when the supplier is required to improve performance along a particular dimension \\nand most of the benefits of improvement accrue to the buyer. A powerful buyer may cou\\xad\\nple shared savings with penalties for a lack of improvement, to further encourage the sup\\xad\\nplier to improve performance. Such contracts will increase profits for both the buyer and \\nthe supplier while achieving outcomes that are beneficial to the supply chain. \\n~\\'~.-- \\'\",, -0~ \\'c; \\n,,-o \\n.•.·•.·.··.~~y·~(.)I.NI•.~h~red-~·~yi~gs,g9::ptr~ptS,:g~n~e···~se~ .. t.O.···In~y9~···p~~~rrt;.~n.c.e .. im.prove\\xad\\n. rrt~nt tr?r]•· i.~wp\\'plie~· .. ~l·9:ntJ~•~in-1.~FYs)oss,.syftl••·~~ ~~~dti,rt;e, \\'Nher~.····the •. benefit· of \\n·····rmprqYeQ1epta~crue~prirpa~Hy.totfle~yfe~{~her~as.Jh~~ffortlor .. if11pr~vement comes \\n.• ·. i:>ri!\"l\"la~lytrofl\\'i~h~.supplre2:.; ·.cr··.• .. · \\n·~····.· .. ·· .. ·. \\n\\' .. \\' \\nl'),\n",

Today, typically between 50 and 70 percent of the spending at a manufacturer is through procurement, compared to only about 20 percent several decades ago. It is generally accepted that about 80 percent of the cost of a purchased part is fixed during the design stage. Thus, it is crucial for a manufacturer to collaborate with suppliers during the design stage if product costs are to be kept low. Design col\\xadlaboration can lower the cost of purchased material and also lower logistics and manu\\xadfacturing costs. Design collaboration is also important for a company trying to provide a lot of variety and customization, because failure to do so can significantly raise the cost of variety. \\nWorking with suppliers can speed up product development time significantly. This is crucial in an era when product life cycles are shrinking and bringing a product to market before the competition offers a significant competitive advantage. Finally, inte\\xadgrating the supplier into the design phase allows the manufacturer to focus on system integration, resulting in a higher quality product at lower cost. For example, auto man\\xadufacturers are increasingly playing the role of system integrators rather than compo\\xadnent designers. This is an approach that has been used even more extensively in the high-tech industry. \\nAs suppliers take on a bigger design role, it is important for manufacturers also to become design coordinators for the supply chain. Common part descriptions should be available to all parties involved in the design, and any design changes by one party should be communicated to all suppliers affected. A good database of existing parts and designs can save significant amounts of money and time. For example, when Johnson Controls finds a seat frame from its database that fulfills all customer require\\xadments, it saves the customer about $20 million on the design, development, tooling, and prototyping expense. \\nA survey by the Procurement and Supply Chain Benchmarking Consortium at Michigan State University dramatically demonstrates the impact of successfully inte\\xadgrating suppliers in product design. The most successful integration efforts have seen costs decrease by 20 percent, quality improve by 30 percent, and time-to-market decrease by 50 percent. \\nKey themes that must be communicated to suppliers as they take greater responsi\\xadbility for design are design for logistics and design for manufacturability. Design for logistics attempts to reduce transportation, handling, and inventory costs during distri\\xadbution by taking appropriate actions during design. To reduce transportation and han\\xaddling costs, the manufacturer must convey expected order sizes from retailers and the end consumer to the designer. Packages can then be designed so that transportation costs are lowered and handling is minimized. To reduce transportation cost, packaging is kept as compact as possible and is also designed to ensure easy stacking. To reduce handling costs, package sizes are designed to minimize the need to break open a pack to fulfill an order. \\nTo reduce inventory costs, the primary approach is to design the product for post\\xadponement and mass customization (see Chapter 11). Postponement strategies aim to design a product and production process so that features that differentiate end prod\\xaducts are introduced late in the manufacturing phase. As discussed in Chapter 11, Dell designs its PCs so that all components about which customers have a choice are assem\\xadbled after the customer order arrives. This allows Dell to lower inventories by aggre\\xadgating them as components. Mass customization strategies use a similar approach by designing the product so that inventory can be carried in a form that aggregates across multiple end products. The goal is to design a product so that customization occurs'),\n",

To provide modular customization, the product is \\ndesigned as an assembly of modules that fit together. All inventory is then maintained \\nas modules that are assembled to order. A good example of modular customization is \\nPC assembly at Dell. An example of adjustable customization is a washing machine \\ndesigned by Matsushita that can automatically select from among 600 different cycles. \\nAll inventory is thus maintained as a single product, and each customer uses the \\nmachine to match its specific needs. An example of dimensional customization given by \\nJosepn Pine (1999) is a machine that makes custom house gutters on site, which can \\nthen be cut to fit the dimensions of the house. Another example is National Bicycle, \\nwhich cuts the frame tubing to fit the body size of the customer. \\nDesign for manufacturability attempts to design products for ease of manufacture. \\nSome of the key principles used include part commonality, eliminating right-hand and \\nleft-hand parts, designing symmetrical parts, combining parts, using catalog parts rather \\nthan designing a new part, and designing parts to provide access for other parts and tools. \\n. . \\nKEY POINT .Desig:n~ollaboration.with suppliers can help a firr1Jreduce cost, improve \\nquality: a~d • dea~~s·~ tiR1&-to-market<:As design fesponsfbllity' moves to suppliers, it is \\nimportant to ensure .fhat design for logistics and desigf1 for ma:nufaeturability principles \\nare followed.

Solid integration \\nthroughout the supply chain allowed Ford to bring the new model to market within 36 \\nmonths of program approval. To ensure effective communication, Ford required all its \\nvendors to be on the same software platform for design. Ford also opened all its inter\\xad\\nnal databases to its suppliers and collocated many of the suppliers at its offices. Ford \\nengineers were in constant communication with the suppliers and helped coordinate \\nthe overall design. The result was a significant improvement in cost, time, and quality. \\n14.8 THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS \\nOnce suppliers have been selected, contracts are in place, and the product has been \\ndesigned, the buyer and suppliers engage in procurement transactions that begin with \\nthe buyer placing the order and end with the buyer receiving and paying for the order. \\nIn designing the procurement proces~s, it is important to consider goods that the \\nprocess will be used to purchase. There are two main categories of purchased goods: \\ndirect and indirect materials. Direct materials are components used to make finished \\ngoods. For example, memory, hard drives, and CD drives are direct materials for a PC \\nmanufacturer. Indirect materials are goods used to support the operations of a firm.

The primary goal of the procurement process for direct materials is to coordinate the entire supply chain and ensure matching of supply and demand. The procurement process should thus be designed to make production plans and current levels of component inventory at the manufacturer visible to the supplier. This visibility allows suppliers to schedule component production to match the needs of the manufacturer. The available capacity at the suppliers should be made visible to the manufacturer so that orders for components may be allocated to the appropriate supplier to ensure on-time delivery. The procurement process should also have alerts that warn both the buyer and the supplier of potential mismatches between supply and demand built into it. \\nA good example of a procurement process that focuses on these objectives is the eHub initiative at Cisco. eHub is designed to provide synchronized planning and end-to-end supply chain visibility. Ultimately, Cisco plans to include more than 2,000 of its suppliers,_ distributors, and contract electronic manufacturers in its private trad\\xading network. Another example is the relationship between Johnson Controls and DaimlerChrysler for the 2002 Jeep Liberty. Johnson Controls integrated components from 35 suppliers and delivered the assembly to Chrysler as a cockpit module. As soon as Chrysler notified it of an order for a Jeep, Johnson Controls had 204 minutes in which to build and deliver the module. This was done 900 times every day for about 200 different color and interior combinations. The focus of the procurement process was to completely synchronize production at DaimlerChrysler and Johnson Controls. The result was a ~ignificant reduction in inventory and a better matching of product supply with end customer demand. \\nGiven the focus on numerous low-value transactions, the procurement process for indirect materials should focus on reducing the transaction cost of each order. Transaction costs for indirect materials are high because of the difficulty of selecting goods (many catalogs, which are often out of date), getting approval, and creating and sending a purchase order. The problem is often exaggerated because companies do not have one system for indirect materials. Instead, they use several processes that are not streamlined or integrated. A goode-procurement process that makes search easy and automates approval and transmission of the purchase order can help reduce transac\\xadtion costs. The e-procurement process should also update other interested parties such as accounts payable and receiving. Clearly this is possible only with suppliers that implement online catalogs and automate all transactions with the buyer. Successful examples of e-procurement implementations for indirect materials include Johnson Controls and Pfizer. Both firms built their e-procurement solutions by integrating existing software. Johnson Controls integrated a Commerce One solution with existing'),\n",

Both claim to have seen sig\\xad\\nnificant savings as a result. \\nAnother important requirement for the procurement process for both direct and \\nindirect materials is to be able to aggregate orders by product and supplier. For direct \\nmaterials, the consolidation of orders improves economies of scale at the supplier and \\nduring transport and allows the firm to take advantage of any quantity discounts that \\nmay be offered by the supplier. For indirect materials, the consolidation of spending \\nwith a supplier often allows the firm to negotiate better purchasing discounts. \\nIn addition to the categorization of materials into direct and indirect, all products \\npurchased may also be categorized as shown in Figure 14-2, based on their value/cost \\nand how critical they are. \\nMost indirect materials are included in general items. The goal of procurement in \\nthis case should be to lower the cost of acquisition or the transaction cost. Direct mate\\xad\\nrials can be further classified into bulk purchase, critical, and strategic items. For most \\nbulk purchase items, such as packaging materials and bulk chemicals, suppliers tend to \\nhave the same selling price. It is thus important for purchasing to make a distinction \\nbetween suppliers based on the services they provide and their performance along all \\ndimensions that affect the total cost of ownership. The use of well-designed auctions is \\nlikely to be most effective for bulk purchase items. Critical items include components \\nwith long lead times and specialty chemicals. The key sourcing objective for critical \\nitems is not low price but to ensure availability. In this case, purchasing should work to \\nimprove coordination of production plans at both the buyer and supplier. The presence \\nof a responsive, even if high-cost, supply source as an alternative can be very valuable \\nfor critical items.

For strategic items, the buyer-supplier relationship is long \\nterm. Thus suppliers should be evaluated based on the lifetime cost/value of the rela\\xad\\ntionship. Purchasing should look for suppliers that can collaborate in the design phase \\nand coordinate design and production activities with other players in the supply \\nchain. \\n14.9 SOURCING PLANNING AND ANALYSIS \\nPeriodically, each firm must analyze its procurement spending and supplier perfor\\xad\\nmance and use this as input for future sourcing decisions. One important analysis is the \\naggregation of spending across and within categories and suppliers. Aggregation pro\\xad\\nvides visibility into what a company is purchasing and from whom the product is being \\npurchased. Managers can use this information to determine economic order quantities, \\nvolume discounts, and projected quantity discounts on future volumes. A simple step is to \\nconsolidate spending and ensure that the firm's economic order quantity matches the \\nsupplier's economic production quantity. Managers can thus realize better economies \\nof scale and utilize resources more effectively. \\nThe second piece of analysis relates to supplier performance. Supplier perfor\\xad\\nmance should be measured against plan on all dimensions that affect total cost, such as \\nresponsiveness, lead times, on-time delivery, quality, and delivery accuracy. \\nSpending and supplier performance analysis should be used to decide on the port\\xad\\nfolio of suppliers to be used and the allocation of demand among the chosen suppli\\xad\\ners. As discussed in Chapter 12, the portfolio generally should not consist of similar \\nsuppliers. The portfolio should be constructed so that one supply source performs \\nvery well on one dimension, whereas another source performs very well on a comple\\xad\\nmentary dimension. For example, a company can source more effectively using a low\\xad\\ncost supplier with longer lead times along with a high-cost supplier with short lead \\ntimes compared to using only one type of supplier. Similarly, one should not ignore a \\nsomewhat lower-quality source if it is much cheaper than other sources. It is also not \\neffective to use only the cheaper but lower-quality source. It may be very effective to \\nuse the cheaper but lower-quality source along with a higher-quality but more expen\\xad\\nsive source. \\nOnce a supplier portfolio has been determined, the next question is the allocation \\nof demand among the suppliers. The allocation should be related to the economic \\nmanufacturing quantity for each source and its cost of supply. The low-cost supplier is \\ngiven large, steady orders independent of demand, whereas the flexible source is \\ngiven small orders that fluctuate with demand. The flexible source has smaller eco\\xad\\nnomic order quantities and is better able to adjust to the fluctuations. The combina\\xad\\ntion of suppliers results in a better matching of supply and demand at lower cost than \\nusing one type of supplier. \\nKEY P91NT Procurement spending should be analyzed by part and supplier to ensure \\nappropriate economies of scale. Supplier performance analysis should be used to build \\na portfolio of suppliers with complementary strengths. Cheaper, but lower'-performing, \\nsuppliers should be used to supply the base demand, whereas higher-performing, but \\nmore expensive, suppliers should be used to buffer _against variation in demand and \\nsupply from the other source. \\nF\"),\n",

The sourcing software world created many electronic marketplaces in the late 1990s that were expected to transform the purchase of goods and services. Firms such as Chemdex and VerticalNet promised to be the one-stop shop where all members of an industry would buy and sell their goods. For a time, it seemed that sourcing software firms would create the tools of these new hubs of commerce through which every transaction would flow. They were selling the picks and shovels to all the metaphorical gold mining marketplaces. \\nAlas, the electronic marketplace has, in most cases, come and gone, rendering the vast majority of these electronic marketplaces useless. That does not mean that the use of IT in sourcing has come and gone. There are a wide variety of areas in which IT can and is used in sourcing today. In fact, there is a greater diversity of IT sourcing prod\\xaducts than in most supply chain IT areas. All processes within the supplier relationship management process are supported by IT software. Here is a discussion of some of the major IT product areas within sourcing. \\nDesign collaboration. This software aims to improve the design of products through collaboration between manufacturers and suppliers. The software facilitates the joint selection (with suppliers) of components that have positive supply chain characteristics such as ease of manufacturability \\nor commonality across several end products. Other design collaboration activities include the sharing of engineering change orders between a manufacturer and its suppliers. This eliminates the costly delays that occur when several suppliers are designing components for the manufac\\xadturer\\'s product concurrently. \\nSource. Sourcing software assists in the qualification of suppliers and helps in supplier selection, contract management, and supplier evaluation. An important objective is to analyze the amount that an enterprise spends with each supplier, often revealing valuable trends or areas for improve\\xadment. Suppliers are evaluated along several key criteria, including lead time, reliability, quality, and price. This evaluation helps improve supplier performance and aids in supplier selection. Contract management is also an important part of sourcing, as many supplier contracts have complex details that must be tracked (such as volume-related price reductions). Successful software in this area helps analyze supplier performance and manage contracts. \\nNegotiate. Negotiations with suppliers involve many steps, starting with a request for quote (RFQ). The negotiation process may also include the design and execution of auctions. The goal of this process is to negotiate an effective contract that specifies price and delivery parameters for a supplier in a way that best matches the enterprise\\'s needs. Successful \\nsoftware automates the RFQ process and the execution of auctions. Buy. \"Buy\" software executes the actual procurement of material from sup\\xadpliers. This includes the creation, management, and approval of purchase orders. Successful software in this area automates the procurement \\nprocess and helps decrease processing cost and time. \\nSupply collaboration. Once an agreement for supply is established between the enterprise and a supplier, supply chain performance can be improved by collaborating on forecasts, production plans, and inventory levels.

As sourcing software often limits what can be purchased, many people bristle at the loss of freedom to purchase what they feel are the best items for their company. In many cases, people just go around the system and buy the products they want even if they are not purcHasable within the system. Another typical difficulty arises when successful use of the IT system requires col\\xadlaboration among different enterprises. This is always difficult to bring about, as all the firms must be convinced of the benefits of using the system and often each firm is suspicious of the others. However, if collaboration is successful, the benefits can be significant. \\nThe supplier relationship management space has three groups of competitors. \\nTwo best-of-breed groups focus exclusively on sourcing, one focusing on design col\\xadlaboration and another focusing on procurement. Leading design collaboration firms include Agile and Matrix One, whereas the leading procurement firm is Ariba. The third category consists, as usual, of the ERP players, with SAP and Oracle being the strongest. \\n14.11 RISK MANAGEMENT IN SOURCING \\nSourcing risks may result in an inability to meet demand on time, an increase in pro\\xadcurement costs, or the loss of intellectual property. It is important to develop mitigation strategies that help mitigate a significant part of the risk. \\nAn inability to meet demand on time arises because of disruption or delay from the supply source. The risk of supply disruption may be serious, especially with a single or very few sources. This was particularly evident when one of two suppliers of flu vac\\xadcine to the United States was unable to do so in 2004 because of contamination. \\nDisruption risk can be mitigated by developing multiple sources. Given the high cost of developing multiple sources and the resulting loss of economies of scale, it is best to do so for products with relatively high demand. Developing multiple sources is very expensive for products with low demand. Delays from a supply source can be mitigated by carrying inventory or developing a backup source that is more responsive. Carrying inventory is best for low-value products that do not become obsolete quickly, whereas developing a responsive backup source is preferred for high-value, short-life-cycle \\nproducts. \\nThe risk of higher procurement costs can be significant when industry-wide \\ndemand for the product exceeds available supply, exchange rates are unfavorable, or there is a single supply source. For example, commodity prices for steel and crude oil were very high in 2004-2005 because of high global demand in the face of limited sup\\xadply capacity. A portfolio of long-and short-term contracts can help mitigate the risk of higher procurement costs. For example, a significant contributor to the profits at Southwest Airlines in 2004-2005 was the long-term contracts it had in place for the purchase of fuel. Exchange-rate risk can be mitigated using financial hedges or by developing a global supply network that is flexible enough to be reconfigured based on exchange-rate fluctuations. The risk of holdup because of a single source can be countered by developing alternative sources or bringing part of the supply capability in-house.'),\n",

Effective strategies for sourcing result from multifunc\\xadtional collaboration within the firm. A sourcing strategy from the purchasing group is likely to be relatively narrow and focus on purchase price. A strategy developed with the collaboration of purchasing, manufacturing, engineering, and planning is much more likely to identify the correct drivers of total cost. The collaboration must be continued \\nbeyond strategy formulation to the procurement phase, because that is where manufac\\xad\\nturing and engineering are most likely to realize the full benefits of good sourcing strategy. \\n2. Ensure appropriate coordination across regions and business units. Coordination of purchasing across all regions and business units allows a firm to maximize economies of scale in purchasing and also to reduce transaction costs. Other opportunities from improved sourcing, such as better supply chain coordination and design collaboration, \\nhowever, may require strong involvement at the business-unit level to be really effec\\xadtive. Mandating global coordination across all business units may complicate these efforts. Items such as MRO supplies, for which transaction costs and total purchase vol\\xadume have a significant impact on total cost, benefit most from coordinated purchasing \\nacross geography and business units. On the other hand, items for which most of the value is extracted from better design collaboration and coordinated supply chain fore\\xadcasting and fulfillment are better served with somewhat more decentralized sourcing. \\n3. Always evaluate the total cost of ownership. An effective sourcing strategy should not make price reduction its sole objective. All factors that influence the total cost of ownership should be identified and used in selecting suppliers. Supplier performance \\nalong all relevant dimensions should be measured, and its impact on total cost should be quantified. Focusing on the total cost of ownership also allows a buyer to better identify opportunities for better collaboration in design, planning, and fulfillment. \\n4. Build long-term relationships with key suppliers. A basic principle of good sourcing \\nis that a buyer and supplier working together can generate more opportunities for sav\\xadings than the two parties working independently. Solid cooperation is likely to result only when the two parties have a long-term relationship and a degree of trust. A long-term relationship encourages the supplier to expend greater effort on issues that are important to a particular buyer. This includes investment in buyer-specific technol\\xad\\nogy and design collaboration. A long-term relationship also improves communication \\nand coordination between the two parties. These capabilities are very important when sourcing direct materials. Thus, long-term relationships should be nurtured with sup\\xadpliers of critical and strategic direct materials. \\n14.13 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1.

Effective sourcing decisions thus have a significant impact on financial performance. \\nGood sourcing decisions can improve supply chain performance by aggregating orders, mak\\xad\\ning procurement transactions more efficient, achieving design collaboration with suppliers, \\nfacilitating coordinated forecasting and planning with suppliers, designing supply chain con\\xad\\ntracts that increase profitability while minimizing information distortion, and decreasing the \\npurchase price through increased competition among suppliers. \\n2. Discuss factors that affect the decision to outsource a supply chain function. \\nA supply chain function should be outsourced if the third party can increase the supply \\nchain surplus without significant risk. A third party may increase the surplus by aggregating \\ncapacity, inventory, warehousing, transportation, information, receivables, and other factors \\nto a higher level than the firm can on its own. Outsourcing generally makes sense if a firm's \\nneeds are small, highly uncertain, and can be served using resources that can serve other \\nfirms as well. \\n3. Identify dimensions of supplier performance that affect total cost. \\nIn addition to the quoted price, the total cost of using a supplier is affected by the \\nreplenishment lead time, on-time performance, supply flexibility, delivery frequency/mini\\xad\\nmum lot size, supply quality, inbound transportation cost, pricing terms, the information \\ncoordination capability, the design collaboration capability of the supplier, and the supplier's \\nviability. These factors must be evaluated when comparing different suppliers to get a real \\nmeasure of their effectiveness. \\n4. Structure successful auctions and negotiations. \\nBuyers may use sealed-bid first-price, Dutch, English, or second-price (Vickrey) auctions. \\nSuccessful auctions minimize the cost for the buyer and result in the lowest-cost supplier win\\xad\\nning the bid. Under many circumstances, open English auctions achieve this outcome. When \\nrunning an auction, buyers must work to avoid collusion among bidders. Successful negotia\\xad\\ntions are most likely when both parties are well informed about each other's positions and \\nhave multiple dimensions they can use to increase the size of the pie, resulting in a win-win \\noutcome. \\n5. Describe the role of supply contracts and their impact on supplier performance and infor\\xad\\nmation distortion. \\nSupply contracts must take into account the desired objective of the buyer and supplier \\nand the resulting impact on supply chain performance. Contracts can be designed to increase \\nproduct availability, coordinate supply chain costs, increase agent effort, and induce perfor\\xad\\nmance improvement from the supplier. Contracts to increase product availability include \\nbuy-back, revenue-sharing, and quantity flexibility contracts. They are designed to counter \\nthe problem of double marginalization. Buy-back and revenue-sharing contracts increase \\ninformation distortion relative to quantity flexibility contracts. Quantity discounts coordinate \\nsupply chain costs when the supplier has significant fixed costs per lot. Quantity discounts \\nincrease information distortion because of order batching. Two-part tariffs and threshold \\ncontracts are designed to increase agent effort. Threshold contracts can significantly increase \\ninformation distortion and are best implemented over a rolling horizon. Shared-savings con\\xad\\ntracts are most effective when a buyer wants the supplier to improve performance along \\ndimensions such as lead time and quality. \\n6.

Understand the role of revenue management in a supply chain. \\n2. Identify conditions under which revenue management tactics can be effective. \\n3. Describe trade-offs that must be considered when making revenue management decisions. \\n15.1 THE ROLE OF PRICING AND REVENUE \\nMANAGEMENT IN A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nSo far in this book we have focused on managing demand and supply to increase sup\\xad\\nply chain profits. Altering inventories and capacity can change available supply. \\nAdvertising and marketing can be used to spur demand. Beyond these levers, pricing is \\nan important lever to increase supply chain profits by better matching supply and \\ndemand. Pricing influences the amount of product demanded and the total revenue \\ngenerated. Revenue management is the use of pricing to increase the profit generated \\nfrom a limited supply of supply chain assets. Supply chain assets exist in two forms\\xad\\ncapacity and inventory. Capacity assets in the supply chain exist for production, trans\\xad\\nportation, and storage. Inventory assets exist throughout the supply chain and are \\ncarried to improve product availability. \\nTo increase the total margin earned from these assets, managers must use all avail\\xad\\nable levers, including price. This is the primary role of revenue management. \\nTraditionally, firms have often invested in or eliminated assets to reduce the imbalance \\nbetween supply and demand. Firms build additional capacity during the growth part of \\na business cycle and shut down some capacity during a downturn. Ideas from revenue \\nmanagement suggest that a firm should first use pricing to achieve some balance \\nbetween supply and demand and only then invest in or eliminate assets. An excellent \\ndiscussion of revenue management techniques in theory and practice can be found in \\nTalluri and Van Ryzin (2004). \\nConsider a trucking company that owns 10 trucks. One approach that the firm can \\ntake is to set a fixed price for its services and use advertising to spur demand in case \\nsurplus capacity is available. Using revenue management, however, the firm would \\nseek to do much more. One approach is to charge a lower price to customers willing to \\ncommit their orders far in advance and a higher price to customers looking for trans\\xad\\nportation capacity at the last minute. Another approach is to charge a lower price to \\ncustomers with long-term contracts and a higher price to customers looking to pur\\xad\\nchase capacity at the last minute. A third approach is to charge a higher price during \\nperiods of high demand and lower prices during periods of low demand. Another'),\n",

A strategy that adjusts \\nprices based on product availability, customer demand, and remaining duration of the \\nsales season will result in higher supply chain profits than a strategy that fixes price for \\nthe duration of the sales season. \\nAll of these are revenue management strategies that use differential pricing as a crit\\xad\\nicallever to maximize earnings. Revenue management may also be defined as the use of \\ndifferential pricing based on customer segment, time of use, and product or capacity avail\\xad\\nability to increase supply chain surplus. The impact of revenue management on supply \\nchain performance can be significant. One of the most often cited examples is the success\\xad\\nful use of revenue management by American Airlines to counter and finally defeat \\nPeopleExpress in the mid-1980s. PeopleExpress started in Newark, New Jersey, and \\noffered fares that were 50 to 80 percent lower than other carriers. At first the other airlines \\nignored PeopleExpress because they were not interested in the low-fare market segment. \\nBy 1983, however, PeopleExpress was flying 40 aircraft and achieving load factors of more \\nthan 74 percent. PeopleExpress and other new entrants were making significant inroads \\ninto the turf of existing airlines. The existing airlines could not compete by cutting prices to \\nthe level of PeopleExpress because they had higher operating costs. American Airlines \\nwas the first to come up with an effective countermeasure using revenue management. \\nRather than lower the price of all its seats, American lowered prices of a portion of the \\nseats to prices at or below PeopleExpress. Soon other airlines, such as United, followed \\nsuit, attracting many of P.eopleExpress's passengers. This was sufficient to drive down load \\nfactors for PeopleExpress to below 50 percent, a level at which the airline could not sur\\xad\\nvive. Before the end of 1986, PeopleExpress collapsed. \\nAmerican Airlines succeeded primarily because it used differential pricing to \\nlower prices for a fraction of the seats and attract passengers who would otherwise \\nhave flown PeopleExpress. American did not lower prices for the fraction of seats used \\nby business travelers who were not flying with PeopleExpress. Targeted differential \\npricing is at the heart of successful revenue management. \\nRevenue management adjusts the pricing and available supply of assets to maxi\\xad\\nmize profits. Revenue management has a significant impact on supply chain profitabil\\xad\\nity when one or more of the following four conditions exist: \\n1. The value of the product varies in different market segments. \\n2. The product is highly perishable or product wastage occurs. \\n3. Demand has seasonal and other peaks. \\n4. The product is sold both in bulk and on the spot market. \\nAirline seats are a good example of a product whose value varies by market seg\\xad\\nment. A business traveler is willing to pay a higher fare for a flight that matches his or \\nher schedule. In contrast, a leisure traveler will often alter his or her schedule to get a \\nlower fare. An airline that can extract a higher price from the business traveler com\\xad\\npared to the leisure traveler will always do better than an airline that charges the same \\nprice to all travelers. \\nFashion and seasonal apparel are examples of highly perishable products. \\nProduction, storage, and transportation capacity are examples of inventory or capacity \\nthat is wasted if not utilized. The goal of revenue management in such a setting is to \\nadjust the price over time to maximize the profit obtained from the available inventory \\nor capacity. \\nOrders at Amazon. com follow a seasonal pattern, with a peak in December prior to \\nChristmas. Serving this peak would require Amazon.com to deploy a significant amount \\nof temporary processing capacity at high cost. Amazon.com uses revenue management \\nideas to offer free shipping prior to the December peak. This shifts some of the demand\"),\n",

Some commuter railroads use a similar strategy to deal with the distinct peaks in passenger travel. They charge higher fares during peak periods and lower fares for off-peak travel. Differential pricing for peak and off-peak periods results in significantly higher profits. Every product and every unit of capacity can be sold both in bulk and in the spot market. An example is the owner of a warehouse who must decide whether to lease the entire warehouse to customers willing to sign long-term contracts or to save a portion of the warehouse for use in the spot market. The long-term contract is more secure but typically fetches a lower average price than the spot market. Revenue management increases profits by finding the right portfolio of long-term and spot-market customers. Revenue management can be a powerful tool for every owner of assets in a supply chain. Owners of any form of capacity (production, transportation, or storage) can use revenue management if there is seasonal demand or if there are segments that are willing to pay different prices for different lead times to use the capacity. Revenue management can be effective if there is a segment that wants to use capacity at the last minute and is willing to pay for it, and there is another segment that wants a lower price and is willing to commit far in advance. Revenue management is essential for owners of any perishable inventory. Most successful examples of the use of revenue management are from the travel and hospitality industry and include airlines, car rentals, and hotels. American Airlines has stated that revenue management techniques increase their revenues by over $1 billion each year. Revenue management techniques at Marriott raise annual revenues by over $100 million. Revenue management can have a similar impact on all stages of a supply chain that satisfy one or more of the four conditions identified earlier. \\nIn the following sections we discuss various situations in which revenue manage\\xadment is effective and the techniques used in each case. \\n15.2 PRICING AND REVENUE MANAGEMENT \\nFOR MULTIPLE CUSTOMER SEGMENTS \\nA classic example of a market with multiple customer segments is the airline industry, where business travelers are willing to pay a higher fare to travel a specific schedule, whereas leisure travelers are willing to shift their schedule to take advantage of lower fares. Many similar instances arise in a supply chain. Consider ToFrom, a trucking firm that has purchased six trucks, with a total capacity of 6,000 cubic feet, to use for trans\\xadport between Chicago and St. Louis. The monthly lease charge, driver, and mainte\\xadnance expense is $1,500 per truck. Market research has indicated that the demand curve for trucking capacity is \\nd = 10,000 - 2,000p \\nwhere d is the demand from each segment and p is the transport cost per cubic foot. A price of $2 per cubic foot results in a demand of 6,000 cubic feet, revenue of $12,000, and a profit of $3,000, whereas a price of $3.50 per cubic foot results in a demand of 3,000, revenue of $10,500, and a profit of $1,500. The real question is whether the 3,000 cubic feet of demand at a price of $3.50 is from a different segment than the 3,000 additional cubic feet of demand generated at a price of $2 per cubic foot. If ToFrom assumes that all demand comes from a single segment, the optimal price is $2.50 per cubic foot, resulting in a demand of 5,000 cubic feet and revenue of $12,500, as shown in Figure 15-1. However, if ToFrom can differentiate the segment that buys 3,000 cubic feet at $3.50 from the segment that buys 3,000 cubic feet only at $2.00, the firm can use revenue \\n- ---···--~---'),\n",

There are two fundamental issues, however, that must be handled in practice. First, how can the firm differentiate between the two segments and structure its pricing to make one segment pay more than the other? Second, how can the firm control demand such that the lower-paying segmeilt does not utilize the entire availability of the asset? \\nTo differentiate between the various segments, the firm must create barriers by identifying product or service attributes that the segments value differently. For exam\\xadple, business travelers on an airline want to book at the last minute and stay only as long as they must. Leisure travelers, on the other hand, are willing to book far in advarice and adjust the duration of their stay. Plans for business travelers are also sub\\xadject to change. Thus, advance booking, a required Saturday-night stay, and a penalty for changes on the lower fare separate the leisure traveler from the business traveler. For a transportation provider such as ToFrom, the segments can be differentiated based on how far in advance a customer is willing to commit and pay for the transportation capacity. Similar separation can also occur for production-and storage-related assets in a supply chain. \\nIn the presence of multiple segments that can be separated, the firm must solve the following two problems: \\n1. What price to charge each segment \\n2. How to allocate limited capacity among the segments \\nPRICING TO MULTIPLE SEGMENTS \\nLet us start by considering the simple scenario in which the firm has identified criteria on which it can separate the various customer segments. One such criterion may be an airline requiring a Saturday-night stayover. Another might be a trucking company separating customers based on the advance notice with which they are willing to com\\xadmit to a shipment. The firm now wishes to identify the appropriate price for each seg\\xadment. Consider a supplier (of product or some other supply chain function) that has identified k distinct customer segments that can be separated. Assume that the demand curve for segment i is given by (we assume linear demand curves to simplify the analysis) \\ndi = Ai-BiPi \\nThe supplier has a cost c of production per unit and must decide on the price Pi to charge each segment; di is the resulting demand from segment i. The goal of the supplier is to price so as to maximize its profits. The pricing problem can be formulated as follows: \\nk \\nMax2:(pi- c)(Ai-BiPi) \\ni=l \\nWithout a capacity constraint, the problem separates by segment, and for segment i, the supplier attempts to maximize \\n(pi - c)(Ai - BipJ \\nThe optimal price for each segment i is given by \\nAi c \\nPi= 2B· + 2 \\nl \\n(15.1)\"),\n",

What price should the contract manufacturer charge each segment if its goal is to \\nmaximize profits? If the contract manufacturer were to charge a single price over both \\nsegments, what should it be? How much increase in profits does differential pricing \\nprovide? If total production capacity is limited to 4,000 units, what should the contract \\nmanufacturer charge each segment? \\nAnalysis: Without capacity constraints, the differential prices to be charged each segment \\nare given by Equation 15.1. We thus obtain \\n5,000 10 P1 = + - = 125 + 5 = $130 2 X 20 2 and \\nThe demand from the two segments is given by \\nd1 = 5,000 - 20 X 130 = 2,400 \\nThe total profit is \\nand \\n5,000 10 P2 = 2 X 40 + 2 = 62.5 + 5 = $67.5 \\nd2 = 5,000 - 40 X 67.5 = 2,300 \\nTotal profit= 130 x 2,400 + 67.5 x 2,300 = $467,250 \\nIf the contract manufacturer charges the same price p to both segments, he is attempting \\nto maximize \\n(p - 1 0)(5,000 - 20p) + (p - 1 0)(5,000 - 40p) = (p - 1 0)(1 0,000 - 60p) \\nThe optimal price in this case is given by \\n10,000 10 $ p = +-= 88 33 2X60 2 . \\nThe demand from the two segments is given by \\nd1 = 5,000 - 20 X 83.33 = 3,333.4 \\nThe total profit is \\nand d2 = 5,000 - 40 X 83.33 = 1 ,666.8 \\nTotal profit = 83.33 x (3,333.4 + 1 ,666.8) = $416,667 \\nDifferential pricing thus raises the profits by more than $50,000 relative to offering a fixed \\nprice. \\nNow let us consider the case in whic' :;total production capacity is limited to 4,000 \\nunits.

Observe that the limited capacity leads the contract \\nmanufacturer to charge a higher price to each of the two segments relative to the case \\nwhen there was no capacity limit. \\nThe methodology we have described has two important assumptions that are \\nunlikely to hold in practice. The first assumption is that nobody from the higher-price \\nsegment decides to shift to the lower-price segment after prices are announced. In \\nother words, we have assumed that the attribute such as lead time used to separate the \\nsegments works perfectly. In practice this is unlikely to be the case. Our second \\nassumption is that once prices are decided, customer demand is predictable. In practice \\nthere will always be uncertainty associated with demand. Talluri and Van Ryzin (2004) \\nhave an excellent discussion of several models for revenue management that account \\nfor uncertainty and a few models that account for customers being strategic and decid\\xad\\ning on their actions after prices are announced. \\nALLOCATING CAPACITY TO A SEGMENT UNDER UNCERTAINTY \\nIn most instances of differential pricing, demand from the segment paying the lower \\nprice arises earlier in time than demand from the segment paying the higher price. A \\nsupplier may charge a lower price to a buyer willing to commit far in advance and a \\nhigher price to buyers wanting to place their orders at the last minute. To take advan\\xad\\ntage of revenue management, the supplier must limi:.:.lle amount of capacity committed \\nto lower-price buyers even if sufficient demand exists from the lower-price segment to \\nuse the entire available capacity. This raises the question of how much capacity to save \\nfor the higher-price segment. The answer would be simple if demand were predictable. \\nIn practice, demand is uncertain and firms must make this decision taking uncertainty \\ninto account. \\nThe basic trade-off to be considered by the supplier with production capacity is \\nbetween committing to an order from a lower-price buyer or waiting for a high-price'),\n",

The two risks in such a situation are spoilage and spill. Spoilage \\noccurs when the capacity reserved for higher-price buyers is wasted because demand from \\nthe higher-price segment does not materialize. Spill occurs if higher-price buyers have to \\nbe turned away because the capacity has already been committed to lower-price buyers. \\nThe supplier should decide on the capacity to commit for the higher-price buyers so as to \\nminimize the expected cost of spoilage and spill. A current order from a lower price buyer \\nshould be compared with the expected revenue from waiting for a higher-price buyer. The \\norder from the lower-price buyer should be accepted if the expected revenue from the \\nhigher-price buyer is lower than the current revenue from the lower-price buyer. \\nWe now develop the aforementioned trade-off in terms of a formula that can be used \\nwhen the supplier is working with two customer segments. Let p L be the price charged to \\nthe lower-price segment and PH be the price charged to the higher-price segment. \\nAssume that the anticipated demand for the higher-price segment is normally distrib\\xad\\nuted, with a mean of DH and a standard deviation of a H. If we reserve a capacity CH \\nfor the higher-price segment, the expected marginal revenue RH(CH) from reserving \\nmore capacity is given by \\nRH(CH) = Prob(demand from higher-price segment > CH) X PH \\nThe reserved quantity for the higher-price segment should be chosen so that the \\nexpected marginal revenue from the higher-price segment equals the current marginal \\nrevenue from the lower-price segment; that is, RH(CH) = PL· In other words, the quan\\xad\\ntity CH reserved for the higher-price segment should be such that \\nProb( demand from higher-price segment > C H) = pdp H (15.3) \\nIf demand for the higher-price segment is normally distributed, with a mean of D H and \\na standard deviation of aH, we can obtain the quantity reserved for the higher price \\nsegment as \\n(15.4) \\nIf there are more than two customer segments, the same philosophy can be used to \\nobtain a set of nested reservations. The quantity C 1 reserved for the highest-price segment \\nshould be such that the expected marginal revenue from the highest-priced segment \\nequals the price of the next-highest-priced segment. The quantity C 2 reserved for the \\ntwo highest-priced segments should be such that the expected marginal revenue from the \\ntwo highest-priced segments equals the price of the third-highest-priced segment. This \\nsequential approach can be used to obtain a set of nested reservations of capacity for all \\nbut the lowest-priced segment. \\nAn important point to observe is that the use of differential pricing increases the \\nlevel of asset availability for the high-priced segment. Capacity is being saved for these \\ncustomers because of their willingness to pay more for the asset. Thus, effective use of \\nrevenue management increases firm profits and also improves service for the more \\nvaluable customer segment. \\nExample 15-2: Allocating capacity to multiple segments \\nToFrom Trucking serves two segments of customers.

In prac\\xadtice, such a procedure would be very difficult to implement. It is more practical to revise the forecast and the reservation quantity after a period of time over which either the forecast demand or the forecast accuracy has changed by a significant amount. \\nAnother approach to differential pricing is to create different versions of a product targeted at different segments. Publishers introduce new books from best\\xadselling authors as hardcover editions and charge a higher price. The same books are introduced later as paperback editions at a lower price. The two versions are used to charge a higher price to the segment that wants to read the book as soon as it is introduced. Different versions can also be created by bundling different options and services with the same basic product. Automobile manufacturers create a high\\xadend, a mid-level, and a low-end version of the most popular models based on the options provided. This policy allows them to charge differential prices to different segments for the same core product. Many contact lens manufacturers sell the same lens with a one-week, one-month, and six-month warranty. In this instance, the same product with different services in the form of warranty is used to charge differential prices. \\nTo use revenue management successfully when serving multiple customer seg\\xadments, a firm must use the following tactics effectively: \\n• Price based on the value assigned by each segment \\n• Use different prices for each segment \\n• Forecast at the segment level \\nFreight railroads and trucking firms have not used revenue management with mul\\xadtiple segments effectively. Airlines, in contrast, have been much more effective in using this approach. A major hindrance for railroads is the lack of scheduled trains. Without scheduled trains it is hard to separate the higher-price and lower-price segments. To take advantage of revenue management opportunities, owners of transportation assets in the supply chain have to offer some scheduled services as a mechanism for separat\\xading the higher-and lower-price segments. Without scheduled services it is difficult to separate customers that are willing to commit early from those that want to use the ser\\xadvice at the last minute.'),\n",

PART VI + Managing Cross-Functional Drivers in a Supply Chain \\nKEY POINT If a supplier serves multiple customer segments with a fixed asset, it can \\nimprove revenues by setting different prices for each segment. Prices must be set with \\nbarriers such that the segment willing to pay more is not able to pay the lower price. \\nThe amount of the asset reserved for the higher-price segment is such that the \\nexpected marginal revenue from the higher-price segment equals the price to the lower\\xad\\nprice segment. \\n15.3 PRICING AND REVENUE MANAGEMENT \\nFOR PERISHABLE ASSETS \\nAny asset that loses value over time is perishable. Clearly, fruits, vegetables, and phar\\xad\\nmaceuticals are perishable. This list also includes products such as computers and cell \\nphones that lose value as new models are introduced. High-fashion apparel is perish\\xad\\nable because it cannot be sold at full price once the season is past. Perishable assets \\nalso include all forms of production, transportation, and storage capacity that is wasted \\nif not fully utilized. Unused capacity from the past has no value. Thus all unutilized \\ncapacity is equivalent to perished capacity. \\nDell uses revenue management when selling PCs. The year is divided into short \\nsales cycles of about two weeks. Once the sales organization makes a forecast for the \\nnext sales cycle, operations ensures the availability of components and production \\ncapacity. At this point the investment in inventory and capacity assets for the next sales \\ncycle is fixed. Sales then attempts to maximize the revenue that can be obtained from \\nthe available assets by adjusting price and availability. \\nA well-known example of revenue management in retailing of apparel was the \\noriginal Filene's Basement in Boston. Merchandise was first sold at the main store at \\nfull price. Leftover merchandise was moved to the basement and its price reduced \\nincrementally over a 35-day period until it sold. Any unsold merchandise was then \\ngiven away to charity. Today, most department stores progressively discount merchan\\xad\\ndise over the sales season and then sell any remaining inventory to an outlet store, \\nwhich follows a similar pricing strategy. \\nAnother example of revenue management for a perishable asset is the use of over\\xad\\nbooking by the airline industry. An airplane seat loses all value once the plane takes \\noff. Given that people often do not show up for a plane even when they have a reser\\xad\\nvation, airlines sell more reservations than the capacity of the plane, to maximize \\nexpected revenue. \\nThe two revenue management tactics used for perishable assets are \\n1. Vary price dynamically over time to maximize expected revenue \\n2. Overbook sales of the asset to account for cancellations \\nDYNAMIC PRICING \\nDynamic pricing, the tactic of varying price over time, is suitable for assets such as fash\\xad\\nion apparel that have a clear date beyond which they lose a lot of their value. Apparel \\ndesigned for the winter does not have much value by April. A retailer that has pur\\xad\\nchased 100 ski jackets in October has many options with regard to its pricing strategy. \\n· It can charge a high price initially.

Another option is to charge a lower \\nprice initially, selling more jackets early in the season (though at a lower price) and \\nleaving fewer jackets to be sold at a discount. This trade-off determines the profits for \\nthe retailer. To vary price effectively over time for a perishable asset, the asset owner \\nmust be able to estimate the value of the asset over time and forecast the impact of \\nprice on customer demand effectively. Effective differential pricing over time generally \\nincreases the level of product availability for the consumer willing to pay full price and \\nalso increases total profits for the retailer. \\nWe now discuss a simple methodology for dynamic pricing in the context where \\nthe seller has a specified quantity Q of a single product at the start of the season. We \\nassume that the seller is able to divide the selling season into k periods and can forecast \\nthe demand curve for each period. The underlying assumption here is that customers\\' \\nresponse to pricing can be predicted over time and customers will not change their \\nbehavior in response to anticipated price changes. For simplicity, we assume that, given \\na price Pi in period i, the demand di in period i is given by \\ndi = Ai- BiPi \\nThis is a linear demand curve, but in general the demand curve need not be linear. \\nWe present the linear case here because it is easier to understand and solve. The \\nretailer wants to vary the price over time to maximize the revenue it can extract from \\nthe Q units it has on hand at the beginning of the season. The dynamic pricing problem \\nfaced by the retailer can then be formulated as follows: \\nsubject to \\nk \\nMax .l\":Pi(Ai - BiPi) \\ni=l \\nk \\n.2: (Ai - BiPi) :5 Q \\ni=l \\nAi - BiPi ;:::: 0 for i = 1, ... , k \\n(15.5) \\nAs formulated, the problem is simple enough that it can be solved directly using \\nExcel. \\nExample 15-3: Dynamic Pricing \\nA retailer has purchased 400 ski parkas before the start of the winter season at a cost of $100 each. The season lasts three months and the retailer has forecast demand in each of the three months to be d1 = 300 - p 1, d2 = 300 - 1.3p2, and d3 = 300 - 1.8p3. How should the retailer vary the price of the parka over the three months to maximize revenue? If the retailer charges a constant price ov~r the three months, what should it be? How much gain in revenue results from dynamic pricing? \\nAnalysis: Observe that customers who buy at the beginning of the season are forecast to be less price sensitive and customers who buy toward the end of the season are more price sensitive. Using Equation 15.5, the retailer\\'s problem can be formulated as follows: \\nMaxp 1(300 - p 1) + p2 (300 - 1.3p2) + P3(300 - 1.8p3) \\nsubject to \\n(300 - P1l + (300 - 1.3p2) + (300 - 1.8p3) ::s 400 \\n300 - p 1, 300 - 1.3p2, 300 - 1.8p3 :::=: 0 \\nThis problem can be formulated using Solver in Excel as shown in Figure 15-4.

Examples include airline seats, items designed specially for Christmas, and production capacity. In each case there is a limited amount of the asset available, cus\\xadtomers are allowed to cancel orders, and the asset loses value beyond a certain date. If the cancellation or the return rate can be predicted accurately, the overbooking level is easy to determine.

The cost of wasted capacity is the margin that would \\nhave been generated if the capacity had been used for production. The cost of a capac\\xad\\nity shortage is the loss per unit that results from having to go to a backup source. The \\ngoal when making the overbooking decision is to maximize supply chain profits by \\nminimizing the cost of wasted capacity and the cost of capacity shortage. \\nWe now develop this trade-off in terms of a formula that can be used to set over\\xad\\nbooking levels for an asset.

In case of asset shortage, \\nlet b be the cost per unit at which a backup can be used. Thus, the marginal cost of hav\\xad\\ning wasted capacity is Cw = p - c, and the marginal cost of having a capacity shortage \\nis Cs = b - p. If the cost of backup capacity is less than the sale price, there is no rea\\xad\\nson to limit the overbooking.

Most \\nretailers in the United States achieve a significant fraction of their annual sales during \\nthe month of December. One such example is Amazon.com. As a result of the seasonal \\npeak, there is a significant increase in the requirement for picking and packing as well \\nas transportation capacity at Amazon.com. Bringing in short-term capacity is expen\\xad\\nsive and decreases Amazon's margins. As discussed in Chapter 9, off-peak discounting \\nis an effective method of shifting demand from the peak to the off-peak period. \\nAmazon.com typically offers free shipping for orders that are placed in November. The \\nprice discount encourages some customers to shift their demand from December to \\nNovember, thereby reducing the December peak for Amazon.com and allowing it to\"),\n",

Simultaneously, this strategy offers a price break to customers \\nwho are willing to order early. \\nFaced with seasonal peaks, an effective revenue management tactic is to charge a \\nhigher price during the peak period and a lower price during off -peak periods. The \\nresult is a demand shift from peak to off-peak periods. Such an outcome is beneficial if \\nthe discount given during the off-peak period is more than offset by the decrease in \\ncost because of a smaller peak and the increase in revenue during the off-peak period. \\nSee Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion of the trade-offs involved when a firm uses pric\\xad\\ning to deal with seasonal peaks. \\nThe hotel industry uses differential pricing by day of week and time of year. Here \\nthe goal is not to shift demand but to increase demand during periods of low demand \\nby attracting price-sensitive customers, such as vacationing families, with a price dis\\xad\\ncount. The Marriott Corporation has been quite successful in this effort. Demand for \\nhotel rooms is known to vary by day of the week. For Marriott, which targets business \\ncustomers, peak demand days occur in the middle of the week. Marriott offers lower \\nrates during the weekend to encourage families to use the hotel during that time .. \\nAnother revenue management tactic that Marriott uses is to charge customers a lower \\nrate if they stay over a longer period that also covers low-demand days. \\nOff-peak discounting can be an effective revenue management tactic for owners of \\nproduction or transportation capacity in any supply chain facing seasonal peak \\ndemand, because changing capacity over time is expensive. This tactic increases profits \\nfor the owner of assets, decreases the price paid by a fraction of customers, and also \\nbrings in potentially new customers during the off-peak discount period. \\n15.5 PRICING AND REVENUE MANAGEMENT \\nFOR BULK AND SPOT CONTRACTS \\nMost firms face a market in which some customers purchase in bulk at a discount and \\nothers buy single units or small lots at a higher price. Consider an owner of warehous\\xad\\ning capacity in a supply chain. Warehousing capacity may be leased in bulk to a large \\ncompany or in small amounts to large companies for their emergency needs or to small \\ncompanies. The large company leasing space in bulk typically gets a discount compared \\nto the others. The owner of warehousing space thus faces the following trade-off. It \\ncould lease the space to the bulk buyer at a discount or save some of the space for \\nhigher price demand for small amounts of warehouse space that may or may not arise. \\nIn most instances, owners of supply chain assets prefer to fulfill all demand that \\narises from bulk sales and try to serve small customers only if any assets are left over. \\nIn contrast, a firm such as McMaster-Carr targets only customers with emergency \\ndemand for MRO goods. McMaster-Carr will turn down any bulk buyer seeking a dis\\xad\\ncount. Using this strategy, McMaster-Carris a very profitable firm. For a firm that \\nwants to be a niche player, targeting one of the two extremes is a sensible strategy. It \\nallows the firm to focus its operations on serving either only the bulk segment or only \\nthe spot market. For other firms, however, a hybrid strategy of serving both segments is \\nappropriate. In this case, firms must decide what fraction of the asset to sell in bulk and \\nwhat fraction of the asset to save for the spot market. The fundamental trade-off is sim\\xad\\nilar to the case in which a firm serves two market segments (see Section 15.2). The firm \\nneeds to decide on the prices to the bulk and spot segments and the amount of the \\nasset to reserve for the spot market. The prices to each segment can be determined \\nusing Equations 15.1 and 15.2. The amount reserved for the spot market should be such'),\n",

The reserved quantity is affected by the difference in margin between \\nthe spot market and the bulk sale and also the distribution of demand from the spot \\nmarket. If we consider the spot market to be the higher-price segment and the bulk \\npurchasers to be the lower-price segment, the amount of asset to be saved for the spot \\nmarket can be obtained using Equations 15.3 and 15.4. \\nA similar decision needs to be made oy each purchaser of production, warehousing, \\nand transportation assets in a supply chain. Consider a company looking for shipping \\ncapacity for global operations. One option is for it to sign a long-term bulk contract with \\na shipping firm. Another option is to purchase shipping capacity on the spot market. The \\nlong-term bulk contract has the advantage of a fixed, low price but has the disadvantage \\nof being wasted if it is not utilized. The spot market has the disadvantage of a higher aver\\xad\\nage price but has the advantage of never being wasted. The purchaser must consider this \\ntrade-off when deciding the amount of long-term bulk shipping contracts to sign. \\nGiven that both the spot market price and the purchaser's need for the asset are \\nuncertain, a decision tree approach as discussed in Chapter 6 should be used to evalu\\xad\\nate the amount of long-term bulk contract to sign. For the simple case in which the spot \\nmarket price is known but demand is uncertain, the extent of the bulk contract can be \\nevaluated using a formula. Let cs be the bulk rate and let cs be the spot market price \\nfor the asset. Let Q* be the optimal amount of the asset to be purchased in bulk and let \\np *be the probability that demand for the asset does not exceed Q*. The marginal cost \\nof purchasing another unit in bulk is cs. The expected marginal cost of not purchasing \\nanother unit in bulk and then purchasing it in the spot market is (1 - p *)cs. If the opti\\xad\\nmal amount of the asset is purchased in bulk, the marginal cost of the bulk purchase \\nshould equal the expected marginal cost of the spot market purchase; that is, \\nc B = (1 - p *)cs. Thus, the optimal value p * is obtained as \\n* p = (15.9) \\nIf demand is normally distributed, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of u, the \\noptimal amount, Q*, of the asset purchased in bulk is obtained as \\nQ* = p-1(p*, J..L,rr) = NORMINV(p*, J..L,rr) (15.10) \\nObserve that the amount of bulk purchase increases if either the spot market price \\nincreases or the bulk price decreases. \\nExample 15-6: Long-term bulk contracts versus the spot market \\nA manufacturer sources several components from China and has monthly transportation \\nneeds that are normally distributed, with a mean of 1-l = 10 million units and a standard \\ndeviation of rr = 4 million units.

Transportation capacity is also available in the spot market at an average price \\nof $12,500 per million units. For how much transportation capacity should the manufac\\xad\\nturer sign a long-term bulk contract? \\nAnalysis: In this case we have \\nBulk contract cost, c8 = $10,000 per million units \\nSpot market cost, cs = $12,500 per million units \\nUsing Equation 15.9, we obtain \\n* cs - ca p = cs \\n12,500 - 10,000 \\n12 500 = 0•2 \\n'\"),\n",

The leading software companies \\nin this area evolved primarily from the airline industry and are generally not the lead\\xad\\ners in supply chain software. There are three major areas in which PRM software has \\nhad a major impact. \\nPricing of perishable assets, pioneered by the travel industry, is where revenue \\nmanagement software originated. Even back in the 1980s, airlines became sophisti\\xad\\ncated users of revenue management to improve profitability. Many airlines developed \\ntheir own revenue management systems, with American Airlines as one of the leaders. \\nSabre, a spin-off of American Airlines, is now one of the leading revenue management \\nfirms. The use of revenue management systems has now spread to include hotels and \\ncar rental companies. \\nThe second area of impact for IT within PRM is the pricing of retail goods in the \\nconsumer packaged-goods category. The leaders here have been grocery stores and \\ndrug stores that have utilized this technology to price their products at the retail level. \\nThe pricing problem they tackle involves both the regular as well as promotional pric\\xad\\ning of products. Firms such as DemandTec have been pioneers in this area. \\nPRM systems have also had a significant impact on fashion goods, particularly \\nclothing. Here the challenge revolves around how to optimally mark down the price of \\ngoods as the styles and seasons change. The goal is to mark down the price enough to \\nsell most of the product but without marking it down so much that profit is thrown \\naway. Software firms such as ProfitLogic offer products in this area. \\nThe major pitfalls in the pricing and revenue management area of IT revolve \\naround linking PRM decisions with other areas and systems of the company. Pricing is \\ngenerally determined within a relatively well-defined area of a company, making it \\neasy to set up pricing software. This ease of installation, however, can cause problems \\nif there is no integration with inventory, distribution, and production systems. A com\\xad\\nmon problem is a software recommendation of a price reduction, which in turn brings \\non a surge in demand. This leads to dissatisfied customers if there is insufficient inven\\xad\\ntory because the pricing systems did not communicate with the inventory manage\\xad\\nment system. This lack of coordination can be quite harmful and greatly dilute the \\nbenefits of PRM.'),\n",

Eventually, as has been the case for virtually all supply chain segments, the larger players will gain in this area and become a significant force. At this stage, however, niche players are doing well. \\n15.7 USING PRICING AND REVENUE \\nMANAGEMENT IN PRACTICE \\n1. Evaluate your m·arket carefully. The first step in revenue management is to identify the customer segments being served and their needs. The goal is to understand what the customer is buying, as opposed to what you are selling. If an airline thinks of itself as only selling seats, it cannot use revenue management. It has to think of itself as sell\\xading seats, the ability to book at the last minute, the ability to alter flight plans, and the ability to pick a convenient flight schedule. Only then do revenue management oppor\\xadtunities present themselves. \\nHaving identified the market needs, it is crucial to gather accurate and complete data relating to products offered, prices, competition, and most important, customer behavior. Information about customer behavior is a valuable asset that helps identify consumer preferences. Ultimately, a proper understanding of customer preferences and a quantification of the impact of various tactics on consumer behavior are at the core of successful revenue management. \\n2. Quantify the benefits of revenue management. It is critical to quantify the expected benefits from revenue management before starting the project. Ideally, historical data and a good model of customer preferences should be used to estimate the benefits through a simulation. The outcome of this step should be explicit revenue targets that are to be achieved as a result of revenue management. The revenue targets should be such that all people involved believe in them. The revenue management effort should then be compared to the expected benefit. \\n3. Implement a forecasting process. The foundation of any revenue management system is the forecasting function. To use overbooking with any degree of success, an airline must be able to forecast cancellation patterns. By forecasting we do not mean obtain\\xading an estimate that is always accurate. Forecasting involves estimating demand and also attributing an expected error to the forecast itself. Both the estimated value and the expected error are important inputs into any revenue management model. \\nIt is generally very difficult to forecast at a micro level, where all behavior is essen\\xadtially idiosyncratic. For example, an airline with 100 fare classes will find it very difficult to forecast demand for each class and also forecast the behavior of customers when they find a fare class full. It is thus important to ensure that revenue management tactics are planned over an aggregate enough level that effective forecasting is possible. \\nFinally, as new information becomes available, reforecast to see if the revenue management tactics currently in place are still appropriate. The frequency of forecast\\xading will depend on the amount of market activity. Ideally, the forecast and the revenue management decision should be evaluated after every transaction. \\n4. Apply optimization to obtain the revenue management decision. The goal of opti\\xadmization is to use forecasts of customer behavior to identify a revenue management tactic that will be most effective. The decision to use overbooking by a hotel is only the beginning of the revenue management process. The ultimate success of this effort depends on the level of overbooking used by the hotel. Too high a level of overbook\\xading will lead to upset customers and a high cost of providing them space. Too low a'),\n",

Salespeople must understand the revenue \\nmanagement tactic in place so they can align their sales pitch accordingly. It makes no \\nsense for a firm to offer an off-peak discount if the sales force continues to push people \\ntoward the period with highest prices. The sales force must differentiate between those \\ncustomers who truly need the supply chain asset during the peak period and those that \\nwill benefit from moving their order to the off-peak period. Such an approach will \\nincrease profits for the firm while also satisfying customers. Operations must under\\xad\\nstand the potential outcomes of the revenue management tactics in place and be \\ninformed of actual outcomes taking place. For example, operations in an airline using \\noverbooking must be ready to book passengers who are unable to depart on the full \\nflight onto other feasible flights. \\n6. Understand and inform the customer. Customers will have a negative perception of \\nrevenue management tactics if they are simply presented as a mechanism for extract\\xad\\ning maximum revenue. Such a perception is likely to diminish customer loyalty in the \\nlong term. Thus, it is important for the firm to structure its revenue management pro\\xad\\ngram in a way that revenue increases while improving service along some dimension \\nthat is important to customers that pay the highest price. As discussed earlier in the \\nchapter, a proper implementation of revenue management tactics should achieve both \\noutcomes. It is important for the firm to convey this information to its most valuable \\ncustomers. Remember, a change in behavior by this set of customers can destroy any \\npotential benefit of a revenue management program! \\n7. Integrate supply planning with revenue management. Although the supply planning \\nand revenue management ideas we discuss in this book are valuable in their own right, \\ncombining them can create significantly more value. The point here is not to use rev\\xad\\nenue management in isolation, but rather to combine it with decisions on the supply \\nside. For instance, if, after applying revenue management, a manufacturer finds that the \\nproduction of a short-lead-time facility provides the majority of its profit, it should \\nlook into adding more short-lead-time capacity. Understanding and acting on the inter\\xad\\nactions among supply, demand, and pricing can bring about powerful results. \\n15.8 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Understand the role of revenue management in a supply chain. \\nRevenue management uses differential pricing to better match supply and demand and \\nincrease supply chain profits. Traditionally, firms have changed the availability of assets to \\nmatch supply and demand. Revenue management aims to reduce any supply/demand imbal\\xad\\nance by using pricing as a lever. A big advantage of using revenue management is that a \\nchange in pricing is much easier to reverse compared to an investment in supply chain assets. \\nWhen it is used properly, revenue management increases firm profits while leaving valuable \\ncustomers more satisfied through greater asset availability. \\n2. Identify conditions under which revenue management tactics can be effective. \\nRevenue management tactics can be very effective if the firm serves multiple segments, \\neach placing a different value on the supply chain asset, or the asset is perishable and loses \\nvalue over time, or demand for the asset has distinct seasonal peaks, or the asset can be \\nbought and sold both using long-term bulk contracts and on the spot market. \\n3. Describe trade-offs that must be considered when making revenue management decisions.'),\n",

The trade-off is between saving \\ntoo much and spoiling the asset if the higher-price demand does not materialize and turning \\naway higher-price customers because too little of the asset was saved. When the asset is per\\xad\\nishable, the basic revenue management decisions are about how to change the asset price \\nover time and the degree to which the asset should be overbooked or oversold. When chang\\xad\\ning the asset price over time, the trade-off is between charging a higher price initially and \\nhaving too much inventory left over to discount later on, and charging a low initial price and \\nhaving little inventory left over. When overbooking, the trade-off is between not overbook\\xad\\ning enough and wasting the available asset and overbooking too much and having to arrange \\nfor backup capacity at high cost. When demand has distinct seasonal peaks, the basic rev\\xad\\nenue management decision is the timing and extent of the off-peak discount. The trade-off is \\nbetween the additional cost of serving the seasonal peak, and the impact on demand and \\nthus revenue from offering an off-peak discount. For a seller using both long-term bulk con\\xad\\ntracts and the spot market, the basic revenue management decision is the fraction of the \\nasset to save for the spot market. The basic trade-off is between getting a committed demand \\nat a lower price with the bulk contract and potentially getting a high price on the spot mar\\xad\\nket. For a buyer, the basic decision is the fraction of anticipated demand to purchase from a \\nlong-term bulk contract. The basic trade-off is between getting a long-term bulk contract at \\na low price that may not be fully used, and purchasing only the amount required from the \\nspot market but at a higher price. \\nDiscussion Questions \\nExercises \\n~--\\n1.

Understand the importance of information and information technology in a supply chain. \\n2. Know at a high level how the supply chain drivers use information. \\n3. Understand the major applications of supply chain information technology and the \\nprocesses that they enable. \\nI\\nnformation is crucial to the performance of a supply chain because it provides the \\nbasis on which supply chain managers make decisions.

In this chapter we \\nexplore the importance of information, its uses, and the technologies that enable supply \\nchain managers to use information to make better decisions. \\n16.1 THE ROLE OF IT IN A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nInformation is a key supply chain driver because it serves as the glue that allows the \\nother supply chain drivers to work together with the goal of creating an integrated, \\ncoordinated supply chain. Information is crucial to supply chain performance \\nbecause it provides the foundation on which supply chain processes execute transac\\xad\\ntions and managers make decisions. Without information, a manager cannot know \\nwhat customers want, how much inventory is in stock, and when more product should \\nbe produced or shipped. In short, without information, a manager can only make \\ndecisions blindly. Therefore, information makes the supply chain visible to a manager. \\nWith this visibility, a manager can make decisions to improve the supply chain's \\nperformance. \\nGiven the role of information in a supply chain's success, managers must under\\xad\\nstand how information is gathered and analyzed. This is where IT comes into play. IT \\nconsists of the hardware, software, and people throughout a supply chain that gather, \\nanalyze, and execute upon information. IT serves as the eyes and ears (and sometimes \\na portion of the brain) of management in a supply chain, capturing and analyzing the \\ninformation necessary to make a good decision. For instance, an IT system at a PC \\nmanufacturer may tell a manager how many processors are currently in stock. IT is \\nalso used to analyze the information and recommend an action. In this role, an IT \\nsystem could take the number of processors in inventory, look at demand forecasts, and \\ndetermine whether to order more processors from Intel.\"),\n",

For example, a major manufacturer of computer workstations \\nand servers found that most of its information on customer demand was not being used \\nto set production schedules and inventory levels. The manufacturing group lacked this \\ndemand information, which essentially forced them to make inventory and production \\ndecisions blindly. By installing a supply chain software system, the company was able to \\ngather and analyze demand data to produce recommended stocking levels. Using the \\nIT system enabled the company to cut its inventory in half, because managers could \\nnow make decisions based on customer demand information rather than manufactur\\xad\\ning's educated guesses. Large impacts like this underscore the importance of IT as a \\ndriver of supply chain performance. \\nInformation is the key to the success of a supply chain because it enables manage\\xad\\nment to make decisions over a broad scope that crosses both functions and companies. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, successful supply chain strategy results from viewing the \\nsupply chain as a whole rather than looking only at the individual stages. By consider\\xad\\ning a global scope across the entire supply chain, a manager is able to craft strategies \\nthat take into account all factors that affect the supply chain rather than just those fac\\xad\\ntors that affect a particular stage or function within the supply chain. Taking the entire \\nchain into account maximizes the profit of the total supply chain, which then leads to \\nhigher profits for each individual company within the supply chain. \\nHow does a manager get this broad scope? The supply chain scope is made up \\nentirely of information, and the breadth of this information determines whether the \\nscope is global or local. To obtain a global scope of the supply chain, a manager needs \\naccurate and timely information on all company functions and organizations in the \\nsupply chain. For example, in trying to determine production schedules, it is not \\nenough for the workstation manufacturer mentioned earlier to know how much inven\\xad\\ntory is on hand within the company. The manager also needs to know the downstream \\ndemand and even the upstream supplier lead times and variability. With this broader \\nscope, the company is able to set production schedules and inventory levels that maxi\\xad\\nmize profitability. \\nInformation must have the following characteristics to be useful when making sup\\xad\\nply chain decisions: \\n1. Information must be accurate. Without information that gives a true picture of the \\nstate of the supply chain, it is very difficult to make good decisions. That is not to \\nsay that all information must be 100 percent correct, but rather that the data avail\\xad\\nable paint a picture that is at least directionally correct. \\n2. Information must be accessible in a timely manner. Often, accurate information \\nexists, but by the time it is available, it is either out of date or, if it is current, it is not \\nin an accessible form. To make good decisions, a manager needs to have up-to-date \\ninformation that is easily accessible. \\n3. Information must be of the right kind Decision makers need information that they \\ncan use. Often companies have large amounts of data that is not helpful in making \\na decision. Companies must think about what information should be recorded so \\nthat valuable resources are not wasted collecting meaningless data while impor\\xad\\ntant data goes unrecorded. \\nInformation is a key ingredient not just at each stage of the supply chain, but also \\nwithin each phase of supply chain decision making-from the strategic phase to the \\nplanning phase to the operational phase (see Chapter 1). For instance, information and \\nits analysis play a significant role during the formulation of supply chain strategy by \\nproviding the basis for decisions such as the location of the push/pull boundary of the\"),\n",

Information also plays a key role at the other end of the spectrum, in \\noperational decisions such as what products will be produced during today's produc\\xad\\ntion run. Managers need to be able to understand how to analyze information to make \\ngood decisions. Much of this book deals with just that idea-how to identify a supply \\nchain problem that needs to be solved, obtain information, analyze it, and then make a \\ngood decision to act on that information. \\nFor example, Wal-Mart has been a pioneer not only in capturing information, but \\nalso in understanding how to analyze that information to make good supply chain deci\\xad\\nsions. Wal-Mart collects data in real time on what products are being purchased at each \\nof its stores and then sends these data to the manufacturers. Wal-Mart analyzes this \\ndemand information to determine how much inventory to hold at each store and to \\ndecide when to order new loads of product from the manufacturer. The manufacturer \\nuses this information to set its production schedules to meet Wal-Mart's demand on \\ntime. Both Wal-Mart and its key suppliers do not just capture the information they \\nhave; they analyze it and base their actions on this analysis. \\nInformation is used when making a wide variety of decisions about each of the \\nsupply chain drivers, as discussed here. \\n1. Facility. Determining the location, capacity, and schedules of a facility requires \\ninformation on the trade-offs among efficiency and flexibility, demand, exchange \\nrates, taxes, and so on (see Chapters 4, 5, and 6). Wal-Mart's suppliers use the \\ndemand information from Wal-Mart's stores to set their production schedules. \\nWal-Mart uses this information to determine where to place its new stores and \\ncross-docking facilities. \\n2. Inventory. Setting optimal inventory policies requires information that includes \\ndemand patterns, cost of carrying inventory, costs of stocking out, and costs of \\nordering (see Chapters 10, 11, and 12). For example, Wal-Mart collects detailed \\ndemand, cost, margin, and supplier information to make these inventory policy \\ndecisions. \\n3. Transportation. Deciding on transportation networks, routings, modes, shipments, and \\nvendors requires information including costs, customer locations, and shipment \\nsizes to make good decisions (see Chapter 13). Wal-Mart uses information to \\ntightly integrate its operations with those of its suppliers. This integration allows \\nWal-Mart to implement cross-docking in its transportation network, saving on \\nboth inventory and transportation costs. \\n4. Sourcing. Information on product margins, prices, quality, delivery lead times, and so \\non, are all important in making sourcing decisions. Given sourcing deals with inter\\xad\\nenterprise transactions, there is also a wide range of transactional information that \\nmust be recorded in order to execute operations, even once sourcing decisions \\nhave been made. \\n5. Pricing and revenue management. To set pricing policies, one needs information on \\ndemand, both its volume and various customer segment's willingness to pay, as \\nwell as many supply issues such as the product margin, lead time, and availability. \\nUsing this information, firms can make intelligent pricing decisions to improve \\ntheir supply chain profitability. \\nIn summary, information is crucial to making good supply chain decisions at all \\nthree levels of decision making (strategy, planning, and operations) and in each of the \\nother supply chain drivers (facilities, inventory, transportation, sourcing, and pricing). \\nIT enables not only the gathering of these data to create supply chain visibility, but \\nalso the analysis of these data so that the supply chain decisions made will maximize \\nprofitability. \\n----· ~--~~----\"),\n",

Our vision of this framework is presented in \\nthe next several sections of this chapter. It is important to note that the use of informa\\xad\\ntion in the supply chain has increasingly been enabled by enterprise software. Enterprise \\nsoftware collects transaction data, analyzes these data to make decisions, and executes on \\nthese decisions both within an enterprise and across a supply chain. Certainly other parts \\nof IT beyond enterprise software, such as hardware, implementation services, and sup\\xad\\nport, are all crucial to making IT effective. Within a supply chain, however, the different \\ncapabilities provided by IT have as their most basic building block the capabilities of the \\nsupply chain's enterprise software. In many ways, software shapes the entire industry of \\nenterprise IT as the other components follow the software lead. It is for this reason that \\nwe use enterprise software and its evolution as the primary guide in analyzing IT and its \\nimpact on the supply chain. The evolution of enterprise software provides insights not \\nonly into the future of IT, but also into what the key supply chain processes are. We now \\ndiscuss this evolution and its impact on companies' supply chain processes. \\nThe enterprise software landscape became increasingly overpopulated during the \\nlate 1990s. The unprecedented flow of venture capital into new software companies led \\nnot just to an increase in the number of software companies, but also to the prolifera\\xad\\ntion of entire categories of software. The growth of the number of software companies, \\nthe emergence of new categories, and the expansion of software product lines com\\xad\\nbined to create an enterprise software landscape that was not only much more \\ncrowded than in the past, but also much more dynamic. It was an environment ripe for \\nsignificant evolutionary change. \\nThe downturn in technology spending in the early 2000s brought about this evolu\\xad\\ntionary pressure, causing many software companies to cease operations or merge with \\nexisting software firms. Some entire software categories are now extinct or close to it, \\nwith many recently created categories landing on this endangered species list. \\nWhat drives this evolution of the enterprise software landscape? Why are some \\ncategories of software companies headed for a profitable long-term future, whereas \\nothers have failed? Certainly there are a wide variety of factors that affect the natural \\nselection of software companies. We propose, however, that three of the main drivers \\nof the evolution taking place in enterprise software are the three major groups of sup\\xad\\nply chain processes, which we call supply chain macro processes. The successful cate\\xad\\ngories of software will be those that focus on the macro processes. The failures, on the \\nother hand, will not have such a focus. \\nTHE SUPPLY CHAIN MACRO PROCESSES \\nThe emergence of supply chain management has broadened the scope across which com\\xad\\npanies make decisions. This scope has expanded from trying to optimize performance \\nacross the division, to the enterprise, and now to the entire supply chain. This broadening \\nof scope emphasizes the importance of including processes all along the supply chain \\nwhen making decisions. From an enterprise's perspective, all processes within its supply \\nchain can be categorized into three main areas: processes focused downstream, processes \\nfocused internally, and processes focused upstream. We use this classification to define \\nthe three macro supply chain processes (see Chapter 1) as follows. \\n• Customer relationship management (CRM).

Processes that focus on internal oper\\xad\\nations within the enterprise.

In our definition, supply chain management \\nincludes all three macro processes, CRM, ISCM, and SRM. \\n• Supplier relationship management (SRM). Processes that focus on upstream inter\\xad\\nactions between the enterprise and its suppliers. \\nWe must also note that there is a fourth important building block that provides the \\nfoundation on which the macro processes rest. We call this category the transaction \\nmanagement foundation (TMF), which includes basic ERP systems (and its compo\\xad\\nnents, such as financials and human resources), infrastructure software, and integration \\nsoftware. TMF software is necessary for the three macro processes to function and to \\ncommunicate with each other. The relationship between the three macro processes and \\nthe transaction management foundation can be seen in Figure 16-1. \\nWHY FOCUS ON THE MACRO PROCESSES? \\nAs the performance of an enterprise becomes more closely linked to the performance \\nof its supply chain, it is crucial that firms focus on these macro processes. After decades \\nof focusing on internal processes, a firm must expand the scope beyond internal \\nprocesses and look at the entire supply chain to achieve breakthrough performance. As \\nwe have discussed, the goal should be to increase the total profitability of the supply \\nchain (also referred to as the supply chain surplus). Good supply chain management is \\nnot a zero-sum game in which one stage of the supply chain increases profits at the \\nexpense of another. As discussed in Chapter 2, good supply chain management is \\ninstead a positive-sum game in which supply chain partners can increase their overall \\nlevel of profitability by working together. Therefore, to increase the supply chain sur\\xad\\nplus (and therefore their firm\\'s own profitability) most effectively, firms must expand \\ntheir scope beyond their enterprise and think in terms of all three macro processes. \\nMACRO PROCESSES APPLIED TO THE EVOLUTION OF SOFTWARE \\nAs the downturn in technology spending in the early 2000s applied evolutionary pressure \\non the enterprise software landscape, a distinct pattern emerged. The majority of sur\\xad\\nvivors have chosen to focus their products on improving their customers\\' macro processes. \\nLarger software firms cross over into more than one macro process, whereas others \\naddress only a small portion of a macro process. However, the common theme we see \\nis that to survive, and particularly to thrive, enterprise software firms must focus on one or'),\n",

Almost all areas of enterprise software growth exist within \\nCRM, ISCM, or SRM. Both new companies and large firms within enterprise software are \\nnow targeting these three macro processes much more sharply. In the future, we see the \\nability to improve the three macro processes driving the growth of enterprise software. \\nExamples of failures that did not focus. on these macro processes are B2B market\\xad\\nplaces and the software companies providing marketplace software that proliferated \\nduring 1999 and 2000. Marketplaces focused more on creating whole new information \\nintermediaries within the supply chain rather than on improving the performance of \\nthe macro processes within supply chains. This lack of focus on the macro processes \\nwas a key contributor to the downfall of marketplaces. \\nThe software firms behind the marketplaces have also had a difficult time, with the \\nmajor players Ariba and Commerce One losing well over 99 percent of their peak mar\\xad\\nket capitalization. To survive, these companies have evolved away from being market\\xad\\nplace providers and toward being software firms focused on a macro process. Ariba \\nnow focuses almost exclusively on the SRM macro process, and Commerce One is \\nstruggling to maintain its existence. The few surviving marketplaces have also focused \\non improving the performance of a macro process within the supply chain, rather than \\ntrying to be independent intermediaries as marketplace operators. \\nA third example of a software category that is being transformed by a focus on \\nmacro processes is the ERP category. ERP software has been successful in improving \\ndata availability and integrity within the supply chain, but by itself, data availability and \\nintegrity provide only a portion of the value potentially available. The real value from \\nthese data comes about only when the data can be used to improve decision making. This \\nis where the three macro processes enter the picture. The real value from having ERP \\nsystems in place can only be obtained if these systems can be used to improve decision \\nmaking in the three macro processes. Every major ERP player has realized this and is \\nremaking itself into a company emphasizing products focused on the macro processes. \\nThe drivers of the software landscape are not just important to software providers. \\nCompanies that are users of software must understand these macro processes as well. \\nBy understanding whether software companies are addressing the macro processes \\nand actually enabling improvements in performance in these areas, a company can \\nbetter gauge whether a particular type of software is valuable for it. \\nThe Software Winners in a Macro Process \\nAmong software firms focused on a macro process, the following three factors determine \\ntheir success: \\n1. Functional performance (including ease of use) \\n2. Integration with other macro processes \\n3. Strength of the software firm\\'s ecosystem \\nFunctional performance is important to customers because it provides them with \\ncapabilities to create a competitive advantage. In addition to raw functional perfor\\xad\\nmance (qualities such as the ability to optimize both price and supply in an integrated \\nfashion), we believe that ease of use is crucial to success in this category. Some software \\nhas very advanced functionality but is very difficult to use. As a result, the advanced \\nfunctionality is rarely utilized. Software firms with lower levels of functionality but \\nwith high ease of use can, in essence, provide more \"usable\" functionality to their cus\\xad\\ntomers and therefore gain an edge. \\nThe ability to integrate is important to a customer for a variety of reasons. \\nApplications that are easy to integrate are generally easier to implement and produce \\nvalue. Integration is also crucial across different macro processes. Applications that \\n- --~-----~-----'),\n",

This gives an edge to firms that offer a full line of inte\\xadgrated solutions in all three macro processes. \\nFinally, a firm's ecosystem-the network of software partners and, more impor\\xadtant, systems integrators and installed base-provides assistance in selling and imple\\xadmenting software. Firms that work well with implementation partners and build up large groups of customers trained on their solutions have built a highly defensible posi\\xadtion. For another firm to capture this business requires that it be so superior that it is worth the retraining and reintegration effort, which is often quite significant. For a cus\\xadtomer, a strong ecosystem means a strong network to provide support both during implementation and down the road. \\nAs we stressed earlier, these criteria are also important for customers of supply chain software. These criteria are the key to success for software companies precisely because they improve supply chain performance for firms. Thus, companies should evaluate soft\\xadware providers along these lines to determine their choice of software vendor. We now discuss each of the macro processes, what segments they consist of, who the players are, and what the future will look like. \\n16.3 CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT \\nThe CRM macro process consists of processes that take place between an enterprise and its customers downstream in the supply chain. The goal of the CRM macro process is to generate customer demand and facilitate transmission and tracking of orders. Weakness in this process results in demand being lost and a poor customer experience because orders are not processed and executed effectively. The key processes under CRM are as follows. \\n• Marketing. Marketing processes involve decisions regarding which customers to target, how to target customers, what products to offer, how to price products, and how to manage the actual campaigns targeting customers. Successful software vendors in the marketing area within CRM provide analytics that improve the marketing decisions on pricing, product profitability, and customer profitability, among other functions. \\n• Sell. The sell process focuses on making an actual sale to a customer (compared to marketing, in which processes are more focused on planning who to sell to and what to sell). The sell process includes providing the sales force the information it needs to make a sale and then execute the actual sale. Executing the sale may require the salesperson (or the customer) to build and configure orders by choos\\xading among a variety of options and features. The sell process also requires such functionality as the ability to quote due dates and access information related to a customer order. Successful software providers have targeted sales force automa\\xadtion, configuration, and personalization to improve the sell process. • Order management. The process of managing customer orders as they flow through an enterprise is important for the customer to track his order and for the enter\\xadprise to plan and execute order fulfillment. This process ties together demand from the customer with supply from the enterprise. Order management software has traditionally been handled by legacy systems or been a part of an ERP system. Recently, new order management systems have emerged with additional functionality that enables visibility of orders across the often numerous order management systems that exist within a company.\"),\n",

A call/service center is often the primary point of contact \\nbetween a company and its customers. A call/service center helps customers place \\norders, suggests products, solves problems, and provides information on order sta\\xad\\ntus. Successful software providers have helped improve call/service center opera\\xad\\ntions by facilitating and reducing work done by customer service representatives, \\noften by allowing customers to do the work themselves. \\nThe aforementioned CRM processes are crucial to the supply chain, as they cover \\na vast amount of interaction between an enterprise and its customers. The customer \\nmust be the starting point when trying to increase the supply chain surplus because all \\ndemand, and therefore revenue, ultimately arises from them. Thus, the CRM macro \\nprocess is often the starting point when improving supply chain performance. It is also \\nimportant to note that CRM processes (and also CRM software) must be integrated \\nwith internal operations to optimize performance. Too often, companies operate with \\ntheir customer-focused units working independently from their internal operations. \\nThe need for integration between CRM and internal operations emphasizes the impor\\xad\\ntance of CRM to an effective supply chain. \\nCRM software has been the fastest-growing, and is now the largest, category of the \\nthree macro processes. Software providers in the CRM space have focused on improv\\xad\\ning CRM processes themselves, but have more work to do to improve integration \\nbetween CRM and internal operational processes. Future success will be partially dri\\xad\\nven by the ability to integrate CRM applications into internal operations. \\nThe CRM software landscape consists of three categories of companies: the best-of\\xad\\nbreed winner, the best-of-breed start-ups, and the ERP players. CRM as an enterprise \\nsoftware segment was created by Siebel Systems, the sole company in the best-of-breed \\nwinner category. Siebel rose to prominence in the late 1990s and the early 2000s but has \\nstruggled lately against the larger software firms with broader product lines. Siebel faces \\nserious competition from both best-of-breed start-ups, such as Salesforce.com, as well \\nas from the ERP players, such as SAP and Oracle, which provide a powerful integration \\nstory and strong ecosystems. \\nLooking forward, it appears that Siebel, the last remaining large best-of-breed \\nsoftware vendor, faces a difficult future. While it has successfully fended off threats \\nfrom the ERP players and the smaller best-of-breed players over the years, these firms \\nare finally catching up to Siebel and now pose a very serious threat. The future of the \\nCRM software landscape will likely be dominated by the ERP players SAP and \\nOracle, with some innovative smaller firms having limited success as well. Perhaps \\nSiebel will remain an independent firm, but its influence will likely shrink. It may also \\nbe acquired by one of the larger players we mentioned. Either way, it does appear that \\nhere in this segment, the last segment where the best-of-breed versus the ERP battle \\nstill rages, the ERP players will win, as they have done in every other segment. \\nINTERNAL SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT \\nISCM, as we discussed earlier, is focused on operations internal to the enterprise. ISCM \\nincludes all processes involved in planning for and fulfilling a customer order. The var\\xad\\nious processes included in ISCM are as follows. \\n• Strategic planning. This process focuses on the network design of the supply chain. \\nFor more discussion of this process and the use of IT in it, see Chapter 5 on network \\ndesign in the supply chain.'),\n",

Demand planning consists of forecasting demand and analyzing \\nthe impact on demand of demand management tools such as pricing and promo\\xad\\ntions. For more discussion of this process and the use of IT in it, see Chapter 7 on \\ndemand forecasting as well as Chapters 9 and 15 on pricing. \\n• Supply planning. The supply planning process takes as an input the demand \\nforecasts produced by demand planning and the resources made available by \\nstrategic planning, and then produces an optimal plan to meet this demand. \\nFactory planning and inventory planning capabilities are typically provided by \\nsupply planning software. For more discussion of this process and the use of IT \\nin it, see Chapter 8 on aggregate planning and Chapters 10 and 11 on inventory \\nmanagement. \\n• Fulfillment. Once a plan is in place to supply the demand, it must be executed. The \\nfulfillment process links each order to a specific supply source and means of \\ntransportation. The software applications that typically fall into the fulfillment \\nsegment are transportation and warehousing applications. For more discussion \\nof this process and the use of IT in it, see Chapter 13 on transportation. \\n• Field service. Finally, after the product has been delivered to the customer, it even\\xad\\ntually must be serviced. Service processes focus on setting inventory levels for \\nspare parts as well as scheduling service calls. Some of the scheduling issues here \\nare handled in a similar manner to aggregate planning, and the inventory issues \\nare the typical inventory management problems. For more discussion of I'f's role \\nin this process, see our Chapter 8 on aggregate planning and Chapters 10 and 11 \\non inventory management. \\nGiven that the ISCM macro process aims to fulfill demand that is generated by \\nCRM processes, there needs to be strong integration between the ISCM and CRM \\nmacro processes. When forecasting demand, interaction with CRM is essential, as the \\nCRM applications are touching the customer and have the most data and insight on \\ncustomer behavior. Similarly, the ISCM processes should have strong integration with \\nthe SRM macro process. Supply planning, fulfillment, and field service are all depen\\xad\\ndent on suppliers and therefore the SRM processes. It is of little use for your factory to \\nhave the production capacity to meet demand if your supplier cannot supply the parts \\nto make your product. Order management, which we discussed under CRM, must inte\\xad\\ngrate closely with fulfillment and be an input for effective demand planning. Again, \\nextended supply chain management requires that we integrate across the macro \\nprocesses. \\nSuccessful ISCM software providers have helped improve decision making within \\nISCM processes. Good integration with CRM and SRM, however, is still largely inade\\xad\\nquate at both the organizational and software levels. Future opportunities are likely to \\narise partly in improving each ISCM process, but even more so in improving integra\\xad\\ntion with CRM and SRM. \\nLike CRM, today's ISCM landscape consists of three categories-the former \\nbest-of-breed winners, the best-of-breed start-ups, and the ERP players. The ERP \\nplayers dominate this segment, although this was not always the case. There were \\ntwo best-of-breed winners, i2 Technologies and Manugistics, which were ISCM pio\\xad\\nneers and basically built the category. They showed the power of IT in supply chain \\nmanagement. However, they grew too quickly and spread their product lines across \\ntoo many products, causing them to lose focus. This allowed the ERP players to \\nimprove their functionality relative to the best-of-breed players and eventually to \\ntake the supply chain leadership role away from them. Today, these ERP players are \\nthe only large players in supply chain IT. Manugistics, i2, and some start-ups still\"),\n",

There is a very natural fit between SRM processes and the ISCM processes, as integrating supplier constraints is crucial when creating internal plans. The major SRM processes and the impact of IT on them are dis\\xadcussed in detail in Chapter 14 on sourcing. These processes are the design collaboration, sourcing, negotiation, buy, and supply collaboration processes. \\nSignificant improvement in supply chain performance can be achieved if SRM processes are well integrated with appropriate CRM and ISCM processes. For instance, when designing a product, incorporating input from customers is a natural way to improve the design. This requires inputs from processes within CRM. Sourcing, negoti\\xadating, buying, and collaborating tie primarily into ISCM, as the supplier inputs are needed to produce and execute an optimal plan. However, even these segments need to interface with CRM processes such as order management. Again, the theme of integrat\\xading the three macro processes is crucial for improved supply chain performance. As we mentioned in Chapter 14, the SRM space has three groups of competitors. The best-of-breed design collaboration group is headed by Agile and MatrixOne. The best-of-breed \"buy\" firm is Ariba. And finally, the ERP players SAP and Oracle are major players as well. \\nGiven the youth of the SRM space, the best-of-breed SRM players have not had a chance to develop large functional leads, and their ecosystems are virtually nonexistent. SRM has already attracted all the big players from ERP. As with the other spaces, although best-of-breed players have defined the space and shown where the value can be created, the ERP players have slowly gained in functionality and used their integration and ecosystems to become major players. Therefore, the future SRM landscape is likely to be dominated by these ERP players. \\nAll three macro processes and their processes can be seen in Figure 16\\'-2. \\nSRM !SCM CRM \\nDesign Strategic Market Collaboration Planning \\nSource Demand Sell Planning \\nNegotiate Supply Call Center Planning \\nBuy Fulfillment Order \\nManagement \\nSupply Field \\nCollaboration Service \\nTMF \\n, \\n1 \\n! \\n-~'),\n",

In the early 1990s, when much of the thinking in supply chain \\nmanagement was just getting off the ground and ERP systems were rapidly gaining \\npopularity, there was little focus on the three macro processes we discussed earlier. In \\nfact, there was little emphasis on software applications focused on improving decisions. \\nInstead, the focus at that time was on building transaction management and process \\nautomation systems that proved to be the foundation for future decision support appli\\xad\\ncations. These systems excelled at the automation of simple transactions and processes \\nas well as the creation of an integrated way to store and view data across the division \\n(and sometimes the enterprise). \\nThe huge demand for these systems during the 1990s drove the ERP players to \\nbecome the largest enterprise software companies. SAP continued as the market \\nleader, but other powerful ERP players included Oracle, Peoplesoft, JD Edwards, and \\nBaan. Eventually, however, ERP sales slowed, and today, of the former big five, only \\nSAP and Oracle exist as independent entities. \\nThe real value of the transaction management foundation can only be extracted if \\ndecision making within the supply chain is improved. Thus, most recent growth in enter\\xad\\nprise software has come from companies focused on improving decision making in the \\nthree macro processes. This has set the stage for what we are seeing today and will con\\xad\\ntinue to see in the future-the realignment of the ERP companies into CRM, ISCM, \\nand SRM companies. Already, the majority of ERP players' revenue comes from appli\\xad\\ncations in the three macro processes. A major advantage that ERP players have relative \\nto best-of-breed providers is the inherent ability to integrate across the three macro \\nprocess, often through the transaction management foundation. ERP players that focus \\non integrating across the macro processes along with developing good functionality in \\none or more macro process will continue to occupy a position of strength. \\n16.7 THE FUTURE OF IT IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nAt the highest level, we believe that the three SCM macro processes will continue to \\ndrive the evolution of enterprise software. To this end, we expect to see software \\nfocused on the macro processes become a larger and larger share of the total enter\\xad\\nprise software landscape and software firms that focus on the macro processes to be \\nmuch more successful than those that focus elsewhere. For firms targeting a macro \\nprocess, we see functionality, the ability to integrate across macro processes, and the \\nstrength of their ecosystems as the keys to success. \\nThis conclusion has important implications for companies that are users of soft\\xad\\nware. As we mentioned earlier, the criteria for successful software companies were \\nchosen precisely because they are the characteristics of software that improve the per\\xad\\nformance of its users. Thus, a user of supply chain software should first identify areas \\nwithin the three macro processes where improvement will provide the maximum lever\\xad\\nage. Software and IT decisions should then support the goal of improving performance \\nalong these processes. \\nThere is one final note worth mentioning with regard to the future of new software \\nplayers in this area. One might conclude from our analysis that it will be very difficult \\nfor a new company to break into the ranks of successful enterprise software compa\\xad\\nnies, given the lead in functionality, integration, and ecosystems that existing firms \\n-- -----------------\"),\n",

We believe, however, that there are two potential paths for a company to \\nenter the market. The first is through superior functionality, whether it be specific func\\xad\\ntionality needed by a particular industry or an application with vastly improved ease of \\nuse. In this area, we see start-ups adding value to enterprise software, although it is a \\nvery difficult path to take given the advantages the ERP players hold today. \\nThe other path consists of providing an integrated product that increases the link\\xad\\nages between the macro processes. Certainly, it will be difficult for a start-up to garner \\nthe resources to build an integrated product across CRM, ISCM, and SRM. However, \\na large software company with tremendous resources and a history of pulling disparate \\nproducts into an integrated package could take this path. The one obvious company \\nhere is Microsoft. Microsoft has certainly noticed the growth and size of the enterprise \\nsoftware market and has begun to make a significant effort to enter this space. It has \\nmade two acquisitions of over $1B and is showing more signs that this will be a focus in \\nthe future. Even with these acquisitions, Microsoft is not yet a significant player in sup\\xad\\nply chain software and has targeted only small companies as its customers, leaving the \\nlarge customers and the large revenues to the existing players. Given Microsoft's tried\\xad\\nand-true strategy of going in on the low end and expanding upward, however, it is cer\\xad\\ntainly a company to watch for on the enterprise software landscape. \\n16.8 RISK MANAGEMENT IN IT \\nThere are several risks associated with the use of IT in the supply chain, and the \\nprocess of adding new supply chain capabilities with IT can be fraught with danger. \\nThe larger the change in the IT system, the greater is the risk of a negative impact on \\noperations. The more ingrained IT becomes in companies, the greater is the risk that \\nthe firm will not be able to function properly if IT suffers a major failure. Here we dis\\xad\\ncuss some of the major risks posed by using IT in the supply chain and some ideas for \\nmitigating these risks. \\nThe major areas of risk in IT can be divided into two broad categories. The first, \\nand potentially the greatest, is the risk involved with installing new IT systems. During \\nthe process of getting new IT systems running, a firm is forced to transition from the \\nold processes it used in its operations to the new processes in its IT system. Here trou\\xad\\nble can be found in both business processes and in technical issues. On the business \\nprocess side, new IT systems often require employees to operate according to new \\nprocesses. These may be difficult to learn, take training to execute correctly, or may \\neven be outright resisted by employees who prefer the old way of doing business. \\nGetting the entire organization on board with the changes brought about by a new IT \\nsystem is particularly difficult because top management is often not actively involved \\nin making this transition. In addition to business process adjustments, there are \\ntremendous technical hurdles to overcome in getting new IT systems operational. The \\namount of integration that needs to take place between disparate systems is often \\noverwhelming. When a firm switches over to a new system without proper integration, \\nthe new system is unable to perform all that was promised and sometimes even per\\xad\\nforms worse than the system it was replacing. Even when the employees are bought \\ninto the new process and all the technical hurdles are overcome, it is often a delicate \\nbalance to actually make the transition over to the new system. \\nA firm still faces risks once its IT systems are operating. This is the second of the \\ntwo broad categories we mentioned above. The more a firm relies on IT to make deci\\xad\\nsions and execute processes, the higher is the risk that any sort of IT problem, ranging\"),\n",

These are serious risks that a firm must plan to face. IT also poses a risk in \\nthat it tends to set processes in stone. Perhaps a system only allows a process to be exe\\xad\\ncuted one way. Then the firm settles into a pattern of always doing this process that \\nway. Obviously, there are great efficiency benefits to this, but the firm also runs the risk \\nthat the process is not of the performance level of its competitors and that its systems \\nmake it difficult to change to newer, more effective processes. \\nEach of the major risk categories above has its own mitigation strategies. With \\nregard to implementing IT systems, there are three ideas to keep in mind. The first is to \\ninstall new IT systems in an incremental fashion rather than in a \"big bang\" approach. \\nThis allows a firm to limit the damage should things go wrong as well as to pinpoint \\nproblem areas during the installation process. Second, firms can run duplicate systems \\nto make sure the new system is performing well. By this we mean that the firm can \\nkeep its old system running at the same time the new one is running. If new system runs \\ninto trouble or if the results seem too far off from the old one, the old system can be \\nutilized as it still exists. In fact, even before the new system is actually executing, it can \\nbe simulating (in parallel with the existing system) all the actions it would take. These \\nproposed actions can be monitored to test how the new system will perform when it is \\nactually activated. Finally, implement only the level of complexity that one needs. If \\nyou don\\'t need certain capabilities or added complexities, leave them out of the pic\\xad\\nture, as they can often increase the risk of the project without increasing the potential \\nbenefits. In essence, we want to tailor our IT systems to our supply chain needs, with \\nrisk reduction being one of those needs. \\nOn the operational side, mitigation strategies include data backup systems, systems \\nrunning in parallel in case one should suffer a problem, and a range of security soft\\xad\\nware products that can help to keep a company\\'s systems safe. In addition, picking sys\\xad\\ntems that have the flexibility to change if need be can be important. \\n16.9 SUPPLY CHAIN IT IN PRACTICE \\nIn addition to the sets of practical suggestions for each supply chain macro process dis\\xad\\ncussed earlier, managers need to keep in mind several general ideas when they are \\nmaking a decision regarding supply chain IT. \\n1. Select an IT system that addresses the company\\'s key success factors. Every industry \\nand even compames within an industry can have very different key success factors. By key \\nsuccess factors, we mean the two or three elements that really determine whether or not \\na company is going to be successful. It is important to select supply chain IT systems that \\nare able to give a company an advantage in the areas most crucial to the success of the \\nbusiness. For instance, the ability to set inventory levels optimally is crucial in the PC \\nbusiness, where product life cycles are short and inventory becomes obsolete very \\nquickly. However, inventory levels are not nearly as crucial for a chemical company, \\nwhere demand is fairly stable and the product has a very long life cycle. For the chemi\\xad\\ncal company, the key to success depends more on utilization of the production facility. \\nGiven these success factors, a PC company might pick a package that is strong in setting \\ninventory levels even if it is weak in maximizing utilization of production capacity. \\nHowever, the chemical company should choose a different product, one that excels at \\nmaximizing utilization even if its inventory components are not especially strong. \\n2. Take incremental steps and measure value. Some of the worst IT disasters are due to \\nthe fact that companies try to implement IT systems in a wide variety of processes at'),\n",

The impact of these failures is amplified by. the fact that many of a com\\xad\\npany\\'s processes are tied up in the same debugging cycle all at once, causing productiv\\xad\\nity to come to a standstill. One way to help ensure success of IT projects is to design \\nthem so that they have incremental steps. For instance, instead of installing a complete \\nsupply chain system across your company all at once, start first by getting your demand \\nplanning up and running and then move on to supply planning. Along the way, make \\nsure each step is adding value through increases in the performance of the three macro \\nprocesses. This incremental approach does not mean that one should not take a big\\xad\\npicture perspective (in fact, one must take a big-picture perspective) but rather that the \\nbig-picture perspective should be implemented in digestible pieces. \\n3. Align the level of sophistication with the needforsophistication. Management must \\nconsider the depth to which an IT system deals with the firm\\'s key success factors. There \\nis a trade-off between the ease of implementing a system and the system\\'s level of com\\xad\\nplexity. Therefore, it is important to consider just how much sophistication a company \\nneeds to achieve its goals and then ensure that the system chosen matches that level. \\nThis is important because erring on the less sophisticated side leaves the firm with a \\ncompetitive weakness, whereas trying to be too sophisticated leads to a higher possibil\\xad\\nity of the entire system failing. \\n4. Use IT systems to support decision making, not to make decisions. Although the soft\\xad\\nware available today can make many supply chain decisions for management, this does \\nnot mean that IT applications can make all of the decisions. A mistake companies can \\nmake is installing a supply chain system and then reducing the amount of managerial \\neffort it spends on supply chain issues. Management must keep its focus on the supply \\nchain because as the competitive and customer landscape changes, there needs to be a \\ncorresponding change in the supply chain. \\n5. Think about the future. Although it is more difficult to make a decision about an IT \\nsystem with the future in mind than the present, it is very important that managers \\ninclude the future state of the business in the decision process. If there are trends in a \\ncompany\\'s industry indicating that insignificant characteristics will become crucial in \\nthe future, managers need to make sure their IT choices take these trends into account. \\nAs IT systems often last for many more years than was originally planned, managers \\nneed to spend time exploring how flexible the systems will be if, or rather when, \\nchanges are required in the future. This exploration can go so far as to include the via\\xad\\nbility of the supply chain software developer itself. If it is unclear whether a company \\nwill be able to get support from a software company in the future, management needs \\nto be sure that the other advantages of this product outweigh this disadvantage. The \\nkey here is to ensure that the software not only fits a company\\'s current needs but also, \\nand even more important, that it will meet the company\\'s future needs. \\n1 6.10 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Understand the importance of information and IT in a supply chain. \\nInformation is essential to making good supply chain decisions because it provides the \\nbroad view needed to make optimal decisions.

Describe supply chain coordination, the bullwhip effect, imd their impact on performance. \\n2. Identify causes of the bullwhip effect and obstacles to coordination in a supply chain. \\n3. Discuss managerial levers that help achieve coordination in a supply chain. \\n4. Describe actions that facilitate the building of strategic partnerships and trust within a \\nsupply chain. \\n5. Understand the different forms of CPFR possible in a supply chain. \\nI\\nn this chapter, we discuss how lack of coordination leads to a degradation of respon\\xad\\nsiveness and an increase in cost within a supply chain. We describe various obstacles \\nthat lead to this lack of coordination and exacerbate variability through the supply chain. We then identify appropriate managerial levers that can help overcome the obstacles and achieve coordination. In this context, we also discuss actions that facili\\xadtate strategic partnerships and the building of trust within a supply chain. \\n17.1 LACK OF SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION \\nAND THE BULLWHIP EFFECT \\nSupply chain coordination improves if all stages of the chain take actions that together \\nincrease total supply chain profits. Supply chain coordination requires each stage of the supply chain to take into account the impact its actions have on other stages. \\nA lack of coordination occurs either because different stages of the supply chain have objectives that conflict or because information moving between stages is delayed and distorted. Different stages of a supply chain may have conflicting objectives if each stage has a different owner. As a result, each stage tries to maximize its own profits, resulting in actions that often diminish total supply chain profits (see Chapters 10 and 12). Today, supply chains consist of stages with many different owners. For example, Ford Motor Company has thousands of suppliers from Goodyear to Motorola, and each of these suppliers has many suppliers in turn. Information is distorted as it moves across the supply chain because complete information is not shared between stages. This distortion is exaggerated by the fact that supply chains today produce a large amount of product variety. For example, Ford produces many different models with several options for each model. The increased variety makes it difficult for Ford to coordinate information exchange with thousands of suppliers and dealers. The \\n-----------------\\nI\"\\' \\n! \\n~---\"'),\n",

The result is a loss of \\nsupply chain coordination. \\nProctor & Gamble (P&G) has observed the bullwhip effect in the supply chain for \\nPampers diapers.1 The company found that raw material orders from P&G to its sup\\xad\\npliers fluctuated significantly over time. Farther down the chain, when sales at retail \\nstores were studied, it was found that the fluctuations, while present, were small. It is \\nreasonable to assume that the consumers of diapers (babies) at the last stage of the \\nsupply chain used them at a steady rate. Although consumption of the end product was \\nstable, orders for raw material were highly variable, increasing costs and making it dif\\xad\\nficult for supply to match demand. \\n1Lee, Padmanabhan, and Whang (1997). \\n1'),\n",

This made it difficult for \\nHP to fill orders on time and increased the cost of doing so. \\nStudies of the apparel and grocery industry have shown a similar phenomenon; the \\nfluctuation in orders increases as we move upstream in the supply chain from retail to \\nmanufacturing. Barilla, an Italian manufacturer of pasta, observed that weekly orders \\nplaced by a local distribution center fluctuated by up to a factor of 70 in the course of \\nthe year, whereas weekly sales at the distribution center (representing orders placed by \\nsupermarkets) fluctuated by a factor of less than three.3 Barilla was thus facing \\ndemand that was much more variable than customer demand. This led to increased \\ninventories, poorer product availability, and a drop in profits. \\nA similar phenomenon, over a longer time frame, has been observed in several \\nindustries that are quite prone to \"boom and bust\" cycles. A good example is the pro\\xad\\nduction of memory chips for personal computers. Between 1985 and 1998 there were at \\nleast two cycles during which prices of memory chips fluctuated by a factor of more \\nthan three. These large fluctuations in price were driven by either large shortages or \\nsurpluses in capacity. The shortages were exacerbated by panic buying and overorder\\xad\\ning that was followed by a sudden drop in demand. \\nIn the next section we consider how lack of coordination affects supply chain per\\xad\\nformance. \\n17.2 THE EFFECT ON PERFORMANCE OF \\nLACK OF COORDINATION \\nA supply chain lacks coordination if each stage optimizes only its local objective, with\\xad\\nout considering the impact on the complete chain. Total supply chain profits are thus \\nless than what could be achieved through coordination (see Chapters 10 and 12). Each \\nstage of the supply chain, in trying to optimize its local objective, takes actions that end \\nup hurting the performance of the entire supply chain. \\nLack of coordination also results if information distortion occurs within the supply \\nchain. Consider the bullwhip effect P&G observed in the diaper supply chain. As a \\nresult of the bullwhip effect, orders P&G receives from its distributors are much more \\nvariable than demand for diapers at retailers. We discuss the impact of this increase in \\nvariability on various measures of performance in the diaper supply chain. \\nMANUFACTURING COST \\nThe bullwhip effect increases manufacturing cost in the supply chain. As a result of the \\nbullwhip effect, P&G and its suppliers must satisfy a stream of orders that is much \\nmore variable than customer demand. P&G can respond to the increased variability by \\neither building excess capacity or holding excess inventory (see Chapter 11), both of \\nwhich increase the manufacturing cost per unit produced. \\n2Ibid. \\n3Hammond (1994). \\n-----~~--~----- ------'),\n",

To handle the \\nincreased variability in demand, P&G has to carry a higher level of inventory than \\nwould be required in the absence of the bullwhip effect. As a result, inventory costs in \\nthe supply chain increase. The high levels of inventory also increase the warehousing \\nspace required and thus the warehousing cost incurred. ·/ ··· \\nREPLENISHMENT LEAD TIME \\nThe bullwhip effect increases replenishment lead times in the supply chain. The \\nincreased variability as a result of the bullwhip effect makes scheduling at P&G and \\nsupplier plants much more difficult compared to a situation with level demand. There \\nare times when the available capacity and inventory cannot supply the orders coming \\nin. This results in higher replenishment lead times in the supply chain from both P&G \\nand its suppliers. \\nTRANSPORTATION COST \\nThe bullwhip effect increases transportation cost in the supply chain. The transporta\\xad\\ntion requirements over time at P&G and its suppliers are correlated with the orders \\nbeing filled. As a result of the bullwhip effect, transportation requirements fluctuate \\nsignificantly over time. This raises transportation cost because surplus transportation \\ncapacity needs to be maintained to cover high-demand periods. \\nLABOR COST FOR SHIPPING AND RECEIVING \\nThe bullwhip effect increases labor costs associated with shipping and receiving in the \\nsupply chain. Labor requirements for shipping at P&G and its suppliers fluctuate with \\norders. A similar fluctuation occurs for the labor requirements for receiving at distrib\\xad\\nutors and retailers. The various stages have the option of carrying excess labor capacity \\nor varying labor capacity in response to the fluctuation in orders. Either option \\nincreases total labor cost. \\nLEVEL OF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY \\nThe bullwhip effect hurts the level of product availability and results in more stockouts \\nin the supply chain. The large fluctuations in orders make it harder for P&G to supply \\nall distributor and retailer orders on time. This increases the likelihood that retailers \\nwill run out of stock, resulting in lost sales for the supply chain. \\nRELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN \\nThe bullwhip effect has a negative effect on performance at every stage and thus hurts \\nthe relationships between different stages of the supply chain. There is a tendency to \\nassign blame to other stages of the supply chain because each stage feels it is doing the \\nbest it can. The bullwhip effect thus leads to a loss of trust between different stages of \\nthe supply chain and fnakes any potential coordination efforts more difficult. \\nFrom the earlier discussion, it follows that the bullwhip effect and the resulting \\nlack of coordination have a significant negative impact on the supply chain's perfor\\xad\\nmance. The bullwhip effect moves a supply chain away from the efficient frontier by \\nincreasing cost and decreasing responsiveness. The impact of the bullwhip effect on dif\\xad\\nferent performance measures is summarized in Table 17-1.\"),\n",

If managers in a supply chain are able to identify the key \\nobstacles, they can then take suitable actions to help achieve coordination.

In many firms, sales force incentives are based on the amount the \\nsales force sells during an evaluation period of a month or quarter. The sales typically \\nmeasured by a manufacturer are the quantity sold to distributors or retailers (sell-in), \\nnot the quantity sold to final customers (sell-through). Measuring performance based \\non sell-in is often justified on the grounds that the manufacturer's sales force does not \\ncontrol sell-through. For example, Barilla offered its sales force incentives based on \\nthe quantity sold to distributors during a four-to six-week promotion period. To maxi\\xad\\nmize their bonuses, the Barilla sales force urged distributors to buy more pasta toward \\nthe end of the evaluation period, even if distributors were not selling as much to retailers. \\nThe sales force offered discounts they controlled to spur end-of-period sales. This \\nincreased variability in the order pattern, with a jump in orders toward the end of the \\nevaluation period followed by very few orders at the beginning of the next evaluation \\nperiod. Order sizes from distributors to Barilla fluctuated by a factor of up to 70 from \\none week to the next. A sales force incentive based on sell-in thus results in order vari\\xad\\nability being larger than customer demand variability. \\nINFORMATION-PROCESSING \\nOBSTACLES \\nInformation-processing obstacles occur in situations when demand information is dis\\xad\\ntorted as it moves between different stages of the supply chain, leading to increased \\nvariability in orders within the supply chain. \\nForecasting Based on Orders and Not Customer Demand \\nWhen stages within a supply chain make forecasts that are based on orders they \\nreceive, any variability in customer demand is magnified as orders move up the supply \\nchain to manufacturers and suppliers. In supply chains that exhibit the bullwhip effect, \\nthe fundamental means of communication between different stages are the orders that \\nare placed. Each stage views its primary role within the supply chain as one of filling \\norders placed by its downstream partner. Thus, each stage views its demand as the \\nstream of orders received and produces a forecast based on this information. · \\nIn such a scenario, a small change in customer demand becomes magnified as it \\nmoves up the supply chain in the form of customer orders. Consider the impact of a \\nrandom increase in customer demand at a retailer. The retailer may interpret part of \\nthis random increase as a growth trend. This interpretation will lead the retailer to \\norder more than the observed increase in demand because the retailer expects growth \\nto continue into the future and thus orders to cover for future anticipated growth. The \\nincrease in the order placed with the wholesaler is thus larger than the observed \\nincrease in demand at the retailer. Part of the increase is a one-time increase. The \\nwholesaler, however, has no way to interpret the order increase correctly. The whole\\xad\\nsaler simply observes a jump in the order size and infers a growth trend. The growth \\ntrend inferred by the wholesaler will be larger than that inferred by the retailer (recall \\nthat the retailer increased the order size to account for future growth). The wholesaler \\nwill thus place an even larger order with the manufacturer. As we go further up the \\nsupply chain, the order size will be magnified. \\nNow assume that periods of random increase are followed by periods of random \\ndecrease in demand. Using the same forecasting logic as earlier, the retailer will now \\nanticipate a declining trend and reduce order size. This reduction will also become \\nmagnified as we move up the supply chain.\"),\n",

For example, a retailer such as Wal-Mart may increase the size of a partic\\xad\\nular order because of a planned promotion. If the manufacturer is not aware of the \\nplanned promotion, it may interpret the larger order as a permanent increase in \\ndemand and place orders with suppliers accordingly. The manufacturer and suppliers \\nthus have a lot of inventory right after Wal-Mart finishes its promotion. Given the \\nexcess inventory, as future Wal-Mart orders return to normal, manufacturer orders will \\nbe smaller than before. The lack of information sharing between the retailer and man\\xad\\nufacturer thus leads to a large fluctuation in manufacturer orders. \\nOPERATIONAL OBSTACLES \\nOperational obstacles occur when actions taken in the course of placing and filling \\norders lead to an increase in variability. \\nOrdering in Large Lots \\nWhen a firm places orders in lot sizes that are much larger than the lot sizes in which \\ndemand arises, variability of orders is magnified up the supply chain. Firms may order \\nin large lots because there is a significant fixed cost associated with placing, receiving, \\nor transporting an order (see Chapter 10). Large lots may also occur if the supplier \\noffers quantity discounts based on lot size (see Chapter 10).

Observe \\nthat the order stream is far more erratic than the demand stream. \\nBecause orders are batched and placed every five weeks, the order stream has four \\nweeks without orders followed by a large order that equals five weeks of demand. A \\nmanufacturer supplying several retailers who batch their orders faces an order stream \\nthat is much more variable than the demand the retailers experience. If the manufac\\xad\\nturer further batches its orders to suppliers, the effect is further magnified. In many \\ninstances there are certain focal-point periods, such as the first or the last week of a \\nmonth, when a majority of the orders arrive. This concentration of orders further exac\\xad\\nerbates the impact of batching. \\nLarge Replenishment Lead Times \\nThe bullwhip effect is magnified if replenishment lead times between stages are long. \\nConsider a situation in which a retailer has misinterpreted a random increase in \\ndemand as a growth trend. If the retailer faces a lead time of two weeks, it will incor\\xad\\nporate the anticipated growth over two weeks when placing the order. In contrast, if \\nthe retailer faces a lead time of two months, it will incorporate into its order the antici\\xad\\npated growth over two months (which will be much larger). The same applies when a \\nrandom decrease in demand is interpreted as a declining trend. \\nRationing and Shortage Gaming \\nRationing schemes that allocate limited production in proportion to the orders placed \\nby retailers lead to a magnification of the bullwhip effect. This can occur when a high\\xad\\ndemand product is in short supply. HP, for example, has faced many situations in which \\na new product has demand that far exceeds supply. In such a situation, manufacturers \\ncome up with a variety of mechanisms to ration the scarce supply of product among \\nvarious distributors or retailers. One commonly used rationing scheme is to allocate \\nthe available supply of product based on orders placed. Under this rationing scheme, if \\nthe supply available is 75 percent of the total orders received, each retailer receives 75 \\npercent of its order. \\nThis rationing scheme results in a game in which retailers try to increase the size of \\ntheir orders to increase the amount supplied to them. A retailer needing 75 units \\norders 100 units in the hope of getting 75. The net impact of this rationing scheme is to \\nartificially inflate orders for the product. In addition, a retailer ordering based on what \\nit expects to sell gets less and as a result loses sales, whereas a retailer that inflates its \\norder is rewarded. \\nIf the manufacturer is using orders to forecast future demand, it will interpret the \\nincrease in orders as an increase in demand even though customer demand is \\nunchanged. The manufacturer may respond by building enough capacity to be able to \\nfill all orders received. Once sufficient capacity becomes available, orders return to \\ntheir normal level because they were inflated in response to the rationing scheme. The \\nmanufacturer is now left with a surplus of product and capacity. These boom-arid-bust \\ncycles then tend to alternate. \\nThis phenomenon is fairly common in the computer industry, in which alternating \\nperiods of component shortages followed by a component surplus are often observed. \\nIn particular, memory chip manufacturing has experienced a couple of such cycles over \\nthe last decade. \\nPRICING OBSTACLES \\nPricing obstacles arise when the pricing policies for a product lead to an increase in \\nvariability of orders placed. \\n---~---~-\\n----~--~-~~~-------\\n-----'),\n",

Fisher, \"What Is the Right Supply Chain \\nfor Your Product?\" Harvard Business Review (March-April1997): 83-93. \\nLot Size-Based Quantity Discounts \\nLot size-based quantity discounts increase the lot size of orders placed within the sup\\xad\\nply chain (see Chapter 10). As discussed earlier, the resulting large lots magnify the \\nbullwhip effect within the supply chain. \\nPrice Fluctuations \\nTrade promotions and other short-term discounts offered by a manufacturer result in \\nforward buying, by which a wholesaler or retailer purchases large lots during the dis\\xad\\ncounting period to cover demand during future periods. Forward buying results in \\nlarge orders during the promotion period followed by very small orders after that (see \\nChapter 10), as shown in Figure 17-3 for chicken noodle soup. \\nObserve that the shipments during the peak period are higher than the sales dur\\xad\\ning the peak period because of a promotion offered during this period. The peak ship\\xad\\nment period is followed by a period of very low shipments from the manufacturer, \\nindicating significant forward buying by distributors. The promotion thus results in a \\nvariability in manufacturer shipments that is significantly higher than the variability \\nin retailer sales. \\nBEHAVIORAL OBSTACLES \\nBehavioral obstacles are problems in learning within organizations that contribute to \\nthe bullwhip effect. These problems are often related to the way the supply chain is \\nstructured and the communications between different stages. Some of the behavioral \\nobstacles are as follows. \\n1.

Different stages of the supply chain react to the current local situation rather than \\ntrying to identify the root causes. \\n3. Based on local analysis, different stages of the supply chain blame each other for \\nthe fluctuations, with successive stages in the supply chain becoming enemies \\nrather than partners. \\n4. No stage of the supply chain learns from its actions over time because the most sig\\xad\\nnificant consequences of the actions any one stage takes occur elsewhere. The \\nresult is a vicious cycle in which actions taken by a stage create the very problems \\nthat the stage blames on others. \\n5. A lack of trust among supply chain partners causes them to be opportunistic at the \\nexpense of overall supply chain performance. The lack of trust also results in sig\\xad\\nnificant duplication of effort. More important, information available at different \\nstages is either not shared or is ignored because it is not trusted. \\n17.4 MANAGERIAL LEVERS TO ACHIEVE COORDINATION \\nHaving identified obstacles to coordination, we now focus on actions a manager can \\n· take to help overcome the obstacles and achieve coordination in the supply chain. The \\nfollowing managerial actions increase total supply chain profits and moderate the bull\\xad\\nwhip effect. \\n• Aligning of goals and incentives \\n• Improving information accuracy \\n• Improving operational performance \\n• Designing pricing strategies to stabilize orders \\n• Building partnerships and trust \\nALIGNING OF GOALS AND INCENTIVES \\nManagers can improve coordination within the supply chain by aligning goals and \\nincentives so that every participant in supply chain activities works to maximize total \\nsupply chain profits. \\nAligning Incentives Across Functions \\nOne key to coordinated decisions within a firm is to ensure that the objective any func\\xad\\ntion uses to evaluate a decision is aligned with the firm's overall objective. All facility, \\ntransportation, and inventory decisions should be evaluated based on their effect on \\nprofitability, not total costs, or even worse, just local costs. This helps avoid situations \\nsuch as a transportation manager making decisions that lower transportation cost but \\nincrease overall supply chain costs (see Chapter 13). \\nPricing for Coordination \\nA manufacturer can use lot size-based quantity discounts to achieve coordination for \\ncommodity products if the manufacturer has large fixed costs associated with each lot \\n(see Chapter 10). For products for which a firm has market power, a manager can use \\ntwo-part tariffs and volume discounts to help achieve coordination (see Chapter 10). \\nGiven demand uncertainty, manufacturers can use buy-back, revenue-sharing, and \\nquantity flexibility contracts to spur retailers to provide levels of product availability \\nthat maximize supply chain profits. Buy-back contracts have been used in the publish\\xad\\ning industry to increase total supply chain profits. Quantity flexibility contracts have \\nhelped Benetton increase supply chain profits.\"),\n",

If sales force incentives are based on sales over a rolling \\nhorizon, the incentive to push product is reduced. This helps reduce forward buying \\nand the resulting fluctuation in orders. Managers can also link incentives for the sales \\nstaff to sell-through by the retailer rather than sell-in to the retailer. This action elimi\\xad\\nnates any motivation the sales staff may have to encourage forward buying. \\nElimination of forward buying helps reduce fluctuations in the order stream. \\nIMPROVING INFORMATION ACCURACY \\nManagers can achieve coordination by improving the accuracy of information avail\\xad\\nable to different stages in the supply chain. \\nSharing Point-of-Sale Data \\nSharing point-of-sale (POS) data across the supply chain can help reduce the bullwhip \\neffect. A primary cause for the bullwhip effect is the fact that each stage of the supply \\nchain uses orders to forecast future demand. Given that orders received by different \\nstages vary, forecasts at different stages also vary. In reality, the only demand that the \\nsupply chain needs to satisfy is from the final customer. If retailers share POS data with \\nother supply chain stages, all supply chain stages can forecast future demand based on \\ncustomer demand. Sharing of POS data helps reduce the bullwhip effect because all \\nstages now respond to the same change in customer demand. Observe that sharing \\naggregate POS data is sufficient to dampen the bullwhip effect. We do not necessarily \\nneed to share detailed POS data. Use of appropriate information systems facilitates \\nthe sharing of such data (see Chapter 16). \\nCompanies can also use the Internet to share data with suppliers. For direct-sales \\ncompanies such as Dell, and companies involved in e-commerce, POS data are avail\\xad\\nable in a form that can easily be shared. Dell shares demand data as well as current \\ninventory positions of components with many of its suppliers via the Internet, thereby \\nhelping to avoid unnecessary fluctuations in supply and orders placed. P&G has con\\xad\\nvinced many retailers to share demand data. P&G in turn shares the data with its sup\\xad\\npliers, improving coordination in the supply chain. \\nImplementing Collaborative Forecasting and Planning \\nOnce point-of-sale data are shared, different stages of the supply chain must forecast \\nand plan jointly if complete coordination is to be achieved. Without collaborative plan\\xad\\nning, sharing of POS data does not guarantee coordination. A retailer may have \\nobserved large demand in the month of January because it ran a promotion. If no \\npromotion is planned in the upcoming January, the retailer's forecast will differ from \\nthe manufacturer's forecast even if both have past POS data. The manufacturer must \\nbe aware of the retailer's promotion plans to achieve coordination. The key is to ensure \\nthat the entire supply chain is operating with a common forecast. To facilitate this type \\nof coordination in the supply chain environment, the Voluntary Interindustry \\nCommerce Standards (VICS) Association has set up a Collaborative Planning, \\nForecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) committee to identify best practices and \\ndesign guidelines for collaborative planning and forecasting. These practices are \\ndetailed later in the chapter. \\nDesigning Single-Stage Control of Replenishment \\nDesigning a supply chain in which a single stage controls replenishment decisions for \\nthe entire supply chain can help diminish the bullwhip effect. As we mentioned earlier, \\n. a key cause of the bullwhip effect is the fact that each stage of the supply chain uses\"),\n",

As a result, each stage views its \\nrole as one of replenishing orders placed by the next stage. In reality, the key replen\\xad\\nishment is at the retailer, because that is where the final customer purchases. When a \\nsingle stage controls replenishment decisions for the entire chain, the problem of mul\\xad\\ntiple forecasts is eliminated and coordination within the supply chain follows. \\nFor a manufacturer such as Dell that sells directly to customers, single control of \\nreplenishment is automatic because there is no intermediary between the manufac\\xad\\nturer and the customer. The manufacturer automatically becomes the single point of \\ncontrol for replenishment decisions. When sales occur through retailers, there are sev\\xad\\neral industry practices such as continuous replenishment programs (CRP) and vendor\\xad\\nmanaged inventories (VMI) that are detailed later in the chapter. \\nIMPROVING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE \\nManagers can help dampen the bullwhip effect by improving operational performance \\nand designing appropriate product rationing schemes in case of shortages. \\nReducing Replenishment Lead Time \\nBy reducing the replenishment lead time, managers can decrease the uncertainty of \\ndemand during the lead time (see Chapter 11). A reduction in lead time is especially \\nbeneficial for seasonal items because it allows for multiple orders to be placed in the \\nseason with a significant increase in the accuracy of the forecast (see Chapter 12). Thus, \\na reduction in replenishment lead time helps dampen the bullwhip effect by reducing \\nthe underlying uncertainty of demand. \\nManagers can take a variety of actions at different stages of the supply chain \\nto help reduce replenishment lead times. Ordering electronically, either through \\ne-commerce on the Internet or through older methods such as electronic data inter\\xad\\nchange (EDI), can significantly cut the lead time associated with order placement \\nand information transfer. At manufacturing plants, increased flexibility and cellular \\nmanufacturing can be used to achieve a significant reduction in lead times. A damp\\xad\\nening of the bullwhip effect further reduces lead times because of stabilized demand \\nand, as a result, improved scheduling. This is particularly true when manufacturing \\nproduces a large variety of products. ASNs can be used to reduce the lead time as \\nwell as effort associated with receiving. Cross-docking can be used to reduce the lead \\ntime associated with moving the product between stages in the supply chain. \\nWal-Mart has used many of the aforementioned approaches to significantly reduce \\nlead time within its supply chain. \\nReducing Lot Sizes \\nManagers can dampen the bullwhip effect by implementing operational improvements \\nthat reduce lot sizes. A reduction of lot sizes decreases the amount of fluctuation that \\ncan accumulate between any pair of stages of a supply chain, thus decreasing the bull\\xad\\nwhip effect. To reduce lot sizes, managers must take actions that help reduce the fixed \\ncosts associated with ordering, transporting, and receiving each lot (see Chapter 10). \\nWal-Mart and Seven-Eleven Japan have been very successful at reducing replenish\\xad\\nment lot sizes by aggregating deliveries across many products and suppliers. \\nComputer-assisted ordering (CAO) refers to the substitution through technology \\nof the functions of a retail order clerk in preparing an order through the use of com\\xad\\nputers that integrate information about product sales, market factors affecting \\ndemand, inventory levels, product receipts, and desired se,rvice levels.

The growth of B2B e-commerce is \\nalso reducing ordering costs. For example, General Motors and Ford will require many \\nof their suppliers to be equipped to receive orders on the Web in an attempt to make \\nordering more efficient. More discussion of this idea is included in Chapter 16. \\nIn some cases, managers can simplify ordering by eliminating the use of purchase \\norders. In the auto industry, some suppliers are paid based on the number of cars pro\\xad\\nduced, eliminating the need for individual purchase orders. This eliminates the order \\nprocessing cost associated with each replenishment order. Information systems also \\nfacilitate the settlement of financial transactions, eliminating the cost associated with \\nindividual purchase orders. \\n#The large gap in the prices of TL and LTL shipping encourages shipment in TL \\nquantities. In fact, with the efforts to reduce order processing costs, transportation costs \\nare now the major barrier to smaller lots in most supply chains. Managers can reduce \\nlot sizes without increasing transportation costs by filling a truck using smaller lots \\nfrom a variety of products (see Chapter 10). P&G, for example, requires all orders from \\nretailers to be a full TL. The TL, however, may be built from any combination of prod\\xad\\nucts. A retailer can thus order small lots of each product as long as a sufficiently large \\nvariety of products is included on each truck. Seven-Eleven Japan has used this strat\\xad\\negy with combined trucks, where the separation is by the temperature at which the \\ntruck is maintained. All products to be shipped at a particular temperature are on the \\nsame truck. This has allowed Seven-Eleven Japan to reduce the number of trucks sent \\nto retail outlets while keeping product variety high. Some firms in the grocery industry \\nuse trucks with different compartments, each at a different temperature and carrying a \\nvariety of products, to help reduce lot sizes. \\nManagers can also reduce lot sizes by using milk runs that combine shipments for \\nseveral retailers on a single truck, as we saw in Chapter 13. In many cases third-party \\ntransporters combine shipments to competing retail outlets on a single truck. This \\nreduces the fixed transportation cost per retailer and allows each retailer to order in \\nsmaller lots. In Japan, Toyota uses a single truck from a supplier to supply multiple \\nassembly plants, which enables managers to reduce the lot size received by any one \\nplant. Managers can also reduce lot sizes by combining shipments from multiple sup\\xad\\npliers on a single truck. In the United States, Toyota uses this approach to reduce the \\nlot size it receives from any one supplier. \\nAs smaller lots are ordered and delivered, both the pressure on and the cost of \\nreceiving can grow significantly. Thus, managers must implement technologies that \\nsimplify the receiving process and reduce the cost associated with receiving. For example, \\nASNs identify shipment content, count, and time of delivery electronically and help \\nreduce unloading time and increase cross-dock efficiency. ASNs can be used to update \\ninventory records electronically, thus reducing the cost of receiving. Bar coding of pallets \\nalso facilitates receiving and delivery. DEX and NEX are two receiving technologies that \\nallow the direct updating of inventory records once the item count has been verified. \\nEach of these technologies works to simplify the task of shipping, transporting, and \\nreceiving complex orders with small lots of many products. This facilitates the reduc\\xad\\ntion of lot size, counteracting the bullwhip effect. \\nAnother simple way to minimize the impact of hatching is to encourage different \\ncustomers to order in such a way that demand is evenly distributed over time. \\nFrequently, customers that order once a week tend to do so on either a Monday or \\nFriday. Customers that order once a month tend to do so either at the beginning or the \\nend of the month. In such situations it is better to evenly distribute customers ordering \\nonce a week across all days of the week, and customers ordering once a month across'),\n",

In fact, regular ordering days may be scheduled in advance for \\neach customer. This generally does not affect retailers, but it does level out the order \\nstream arriving at the manufacturer, thus dampening the bullwhip effect. \\nRationing Based on Past Sales and Sharing Information \\nto Limit Gaming \\nTo diminish the bullwhip effect, managers can design rationing schemes that discour\\xad\\nage retailers from artificially inflating their orders in the case of a shortage. One \\napproach, referred to as turn-and-earn, is to allocate the available supply based on past \\nretailer sales rather than current retailer orders. Tying allocation to past sales removes \\nany incentive a retailer may have to inflate orders, as a result dampening the bullwhip \\neffect. In fact, during low-demand periods, the turn-and-earn approach pushes retailers \\nto try and sell more to increase the allocation they receive during periods of shortage. \\nSeveral firms, including General Motors, have historically used the turn-and-earn \\nmechanism to ration available product in case of a shortage. Others, such as HP, have \\nhistorically allocated based on retailer orders but are now switching to using past sales. \\nOther firms have tried to share information across the supply chain to minimize \\nshortage situations. Firms such as Sport Obermeyer offer incentives to their large cus\\xad\\ntomers to preorder at least a part of their annual order. This information allows Sport \\nObermeyer to improve the accuracy of its own forecast and allocate production capac\\xad\\nity accordingly. Once capacity has been allocated appropriately across different prod\\xad\\nucts, it is less likely that shortage situations will arise, thus dampening the bullwhip \\neffect. The availability of flexible capacity can also help in this regard, because flexible \\ncapacity can easily be shifted from a product whose demand is lower than expected to \\none whose demand is higher than expected. \\nDESIGNING PRICING STRATEGIES TO STABILIZE ORDERS \\nManagers can diminish the bullwhip effect by devising pricing strategies that encour\\xad\\nage retailers to order in smaller lots and reduce forward buying. \\nMoving from Lot Size-Based to Volume-Based Quantity Discounts \\nAs a result of lot size-based quantity discounts, retailers increase their lot size to take full \\nadvantage of the discount. Offering volume-based quantity discounts eliminates the \\nincentive to increase the size of a single lot because volume-based discounts consider the \\ntotal purchases during a specified period (say, a year) rather than purchases in a single lot \\n(see Chapter 10). Volume-based quantity discounts result in smaller lot sizes, thus reduc\\xad\\ning order variability in the supply chain. Volume-based discounts with a fixed end date at \\nwhich discounts will be evaluated may lead to large lots close to the end date. Offering \\nthe discounts over a rolling time horizon helps dampen this effect. HP is experimenting \\nwith a move away from lot size-based discounts to volume-based discounts. \\nStabilizing Pricing \\nManagers can dampen the bullwhip effect by eliminating promotions and charging an \\nEDLP. The elimination of promotions removes forward buying by retailers and results \\nin orders that match customer demand. P&G, Campbell Soup, and several other manu\\xad\\nfacturers have implemented EDLP to dampen the bullwhip effect. \\nManagers can place limits on the quantity that may be purchased during a promo\\xad\\ntion to decrease forward buying. This limit should be retailer specific and linked to his\\xad\\ntorical sales by the retailer. Another approach is to tie the promotion doliars paid to the \\nretailer to the amount of sell-through rather than the amount purchased by the retailer. \\nAs a result, retailers obtain no benefit from forward buying and purchase more only if \\nthey can sell more. Promotions based on sell-through significantly dampen the bullwhip'),\n",

The presence of specific information systems facilitates the tying of promotions \\ndirectly to customer sales. \\nBUILDING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND TRUST \\nManagers find it easier to use the levers discussed earlier to diminish the bullwhip \\neffect and achieve coordination if trust and strategic partnerships are built within the \\nsupply chain. Sharing of accurate information that is trusted by every stage results in a \\nbetter matching of supply and demand throughout the supply chain and a lower cost. A \\nbetter relationship also tends to lower the transaction cost between supply chain \\nstages. For example, a supplier can eliminate its forecasting effort if it trusts orders and \\nforecast information received from the retailer. Similarly, the retailer can lessen the \\nreceiving effort by decreasing counting and inspections if it trusts the supplier's quality \\nand delivery. In general, stages in a supply chain can eliminate duplicated effort on the \\nbasis of improved trust and a better relationship. This lowering of transaction cost \\nalong with accurate shared information helps mitigate the bullwhip effect. Wal-Mart \\nand P&G have been trying to build a strategic partnership that will be mutually bene\\xad\\nficial and help reduce the bullwhip effect. \\nManagerial levers that help a supply chain achieve better coordination fall into \\ntwo broad categories. Action-oriented levers include information sharing, changing \\nof inc~ntives, operational improvements, and stabilization of pricing. Relationship\\xad\\noriented levers involve the building of cooperation and trust within the supply chain. In \\nthe next section we discuss relationship-oriented levers in greater detail. \\n17.5 BUILDING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS \\nAND TRUST WITHIN A SUPPLY CHAIN \\nA trust-based relationship between two stages of a supply chain includes dependability \\nof the two stages, and the ability of each stage to make a leap of faith.4 Trust involves a \\nbelief that each stage is interested in the others' welfare and will not take actions with\\xad\\nout considering their impact on the other stages. Cooperation and trust within the sup\\xad\\nply chain help improve performance for the following reasons. \\n1. When stages trust each other, they are more likely to take the other party's objec\\xad\\ntives into consideration when making decisions. \\n2. Action-oriented managerial levers to achieve coordination become easier to \\nimplement. Sharing of information is natural between parties that trust each other. \\nSimilarly, operational improvements are easier to implement and appropriate pric\\xad\\ning schemes are easier to design if both parties are aiming for the common good. \\n3. An increase in supply chain productivity results, either by elimination of dupli\\xad\\ncated effort or by allocating effort to the appropriate stage. For example, a manu\\xad\\nfacturer receives material from a supplier without inspecting it if the supplier \\nshares process control charts. Another example might be a situation in which a dis\\xad\\ntributor aids the postponement strategy of a manufacturer by performing cus\\xad\\ntomization just before the point of sale. \\n4. A greater sharing of detailed sales and production information results. This sharing \\nallows the supply chain to coordinate production and distribution decisions. As a \\nresult, the supply chain is better able to match supply and demand, resulting in bet\\xad\\nter coordination. \\n4See Kumar (1996). \\n,\"),\n",

Kumar, \"The Power of Trust in Manufacturer-Retailer Relationships,\" Harvard \\nBusiness Review (November-December 1996): 92-106. \\nThe benefits of trust are highlighted in Table 17-2 in the context of a replacement \\nautomotive parts supply chain. The table contains average ratings of over 400 retailers \\nclassified into low or high categories (and scaled relative to the level of low-trust \\nrespondents) based on their trust in the manufacturer. For example, the average \\nretailer with high trust toward its manufacturers developed fewer alternative supply \\nsources, was more committed to the manufacturer, sold more of the manufacturer\\'s \\nproducts, and was rated higher by the manufacturer. It also highlights that the retailers \\nthemselves were likely happier when they had greater trust in the manufacturer \\nbecause they were less likely to search for alternative supply sources. \\nHistorically, supply chain relationships have been based on either power or trust. \\nIn a power-based relationship, the stronger party dictates its view. Although exploiting \\npower may be advantageous in the short term, its negative consequences are felt in the \\nlong term for three main reasons: \\n1. Exploiting power often results in one stage of the supply chain maximizing its prof\\xad\\nits, often at the expense of other stages. This decreases total supply chain profits. \\n2. Exploiting power to extract unfair concessions can hurt a company once the bal\\xad\\nance of power changes. This reversal of power has occurred over the last two \\ndecades, with retailers in Europe and the United States becoming more powerful \\nthan manufacturers in many supply chains. \\n3. When a stage of a supply chain systematically exploits its power advantage, the \\nother stages seek ways to resist. In many instances in which retailers have tried to \\nexploit their power, manufacturers have sought ways to access the consumer \\ndirectly. These include selling over the Internet and setting up company stores. The \\nresult can be a decrease in supply chain profits because different stages are com\\xad\\npeting rather than cooperating. \\nAlthough everybody agrees that cooperation and trust in a supply chain are valu\\xad\\nable, these qualities are very hard to initiate and sustain. There are two views regarding \\nhow cooperation and trust can be built into any supply chain relationship: \\n• Deterrence-based view. In this view the parties involved use a variety of formal \\ncontracts to ensure cooperation. With the contracts in place, parties are assumed \\nto behave in a trusting manner purely for reasons of self-interest. \\n• Process-based view. With this view, trust and cooperation are built over time as a \\nresult of a series of interactions between the parties involved. Positive interac\\xad\\ntions strengthen the belief in the cooperation of the other party. \\nIn most practical situations, neither view holds exclusively. It is impossible to \\ndesign a contract that will take into account every contingency that may arise in the \\nfuture. Thus, parties that may not yet trust each other have to rely on the building of \\ntrust to resolve issues that are not included in the contract. Conversely, parties that'),\n",

In most effective \\npartnerships, a combination of the two approaches is used. An example is the situation \\nin which suppliers sign an initial contract containing contingencies with manufacturers \\nand then the manufacturers never want to refer to the contract again. Their hope is that \\nall contingencies can be resolved through negotiation in a way that is best for the sup\\xad\\nply chain. \\nIn most strong supply chain relationships, the initial period often relies more on \\nthe deterrence-based view. Over time, the relationship evolves toward a greater \\nreliance on the process-based view. From the supply chain perspective, the ideal goal is co\\xad\\nidentification, in which each party considers the other party\\'s objective as its own. \\nCo-identification ensures that each stage accounts for total supply chain profits when \\nmaking decisions. \\nThere are two phases to any long-term supply chain relationship. In the design \\nphase, ground rules are established and the relationship is initiated. In the management \\nphase, interactions based on the ground rules occur and the relationship as well as the \\nground rules evolve. A manager seeking to build a supply chain relationship must con\\xad\\nsider how cooperation and trust can be encouraged during both phases of the relation\\xad\\nship. Careful consideration is very important, because in most supply chains, power \\ntends to be concentrated in relatively few hands. The concentration of power often \\nleads managers to ignore the effort required to build trust and cooperation, hurting \\nsupply chain performance in the long term. \\nNext we discuss how a manager can design a supply chain relationship to encour\\xad\\nage cooperation and trust. \\nDESIGNING A RELATIONSHIP WITH COOPERATION AND TRUST \\nThe key steps in designing effective supply chain partnerships are as follows: \\n1. Assessing the value of the relationship \\n2. Identifying operational roles and decision rights for each party \\n3. Creating effective contracts \\n4. Designing effective conflict resolution mechanisms \\nAssessing the Value of the Relationship \\nThe first step in designing a supply chain relationship is to clearly identify the mutual \\nbenefit that the relationship provides. In most supply chains, each member of the part\\xad\\nnership brings distinct skills, all of which are needed to supply a customer order. For \\nexample, a manufacturer produces the product, a carrier transports it between stages, \\nand a retailer makes the product available to the final customer. The next step is to \\nidentify the criteria used for evaluating the relationship as well as the contribution of \\neach party. A common criterion is the increase in total profits as a result of the rela\\xad\\ntionship. Equity, defined here as \"fair dealing,\" should be another important criterion \\nwhen evaluating and designing a relationship.\\n5 Equity measures the fairness of the \\ndivision of the total profits among the parties involved. \\nStages of the supply chain are unlikely to work at utilizing the various manager\\xad\\nial levers that achieve coordination unless they are confident that the resulting \\nincrease in profits will be shared equitably. For example, when suppliers work hard to \\nreduce replenishment lead times, the supply chain benefits because of reduced safety \\ninventories at manufacturers and retailers. Suppliers are unlikely to put in the effort if \\n5Ring and Van de Ven (1994).'),\n",

Thus, a supply chain relationship is likely to be sustainable only if it increases total \\nprofits and this increase is shared equitably among the parties involved. \\nThe next step is to clarify the contribution of each party as well as the benefits that \\nwill accrue to each. For example, if a manufacturer and distributor are to implement \\npostponement together, it is important to clarify the role of each party in implementing \\npostponement, the value of this strategy to the supply chain, and how the increased prof\\xad\\nits are to be shared between the parties. Flexible mechanisms should be designed that \\nallow the partners to monitor the relationship periodically and adjust both contributions \\nand the allocation of resulting benefits. For example, DiamlerChrysler negotiates a cer\\xad\\ntain level of improvement per year with each supplier. It does not, however, specify areas \\nwithin which the improvement must be achieved. This flexibility allows suppliers to iden\\xad\\ntify areas where the largest improvement can result with the minimum effort and creates \\na win-win situation for both sides. \\nIdentifying Operational Roles and Decision Rights for Each Party \\nWhen identifying operational roles and decision rights for different parties in a supply \\nchain relationship, managers must consider the resulting interdependence between the \\nparties. A source of conflict may arise if the tasks are divided in a way that makes one \\nparty more dependent on the other. In many partnerships, an inefficient allocation of \\ntasks results simply because neither party is willing to give the other a perceived upper \\nhand based on the tasks assigned. \\nThe allocation of tasks results in a sequential interdependence if the activities of \\none partner precede the other. Traditionally, supply chain relationships have been \\nsequential, with one stage completing all its tasks and then handing off to the next \\nstage. In reciprocal interdependence, parties come together and exchange information \\nand inputs in both directions. P&G and Wal-Mart are attempting to create reciprocal \\ninterdependence through collaborative forecasting and replenishment teams. The \\nteams contain people from both Wal-Mart and P&G. Wal-Mart brings in demand infor\\xad\\nmation and P&G brings in information on available capacity. The teams then decide on \\nthe production and replenishment policy that is best for the supply chain. \\nReciprocal interdependence requires a significant effort to manage and can \\nincrease transaction costs if not managed properly. However, reciprocal interdepen\\xad\\ndence is more likely to result in decisions that maximize supply chain profitability \\nbecause all decisions must take the objectives of both parties into account. Thus, \\ngreater reciprocal interdependence in the allocation of operational roles and decision \\nrights increases the chances of an effective relationship, as shown in Figure 17-4. \\nManagers must ensure that tasks that are required from each party for a successful \\nhandoff of the product from one to the other are well defined. Consider the relation\\xad\\nship among Dell, Sony, and Airborne. Dell takes orders for computers it assembles and \\nmonitors that Sony manufactures. Airborne picks up computers from the Dell ware\\xad\\nhouse in Texas and monitors from the Sony warehouse in Mexico. It then merges the \\ntwo and sends a combined order to the customer. For an order to be filled on time, all \\nthree parties must coordinate and complete their tasks. To achieve cooperation, man\\xad\\nagers must also put in place some mechanism, such as appropriate information sys\\xad\\ntems, that helps accurately track all failures to their source. \\nCreating Effective Contracts \\nManagers can help promote trust by creating contracts that encourage negotiation as \\nunplanned contingencies arise. Contracts are most effective for governance when \\ncomplete information is available and all future contingencies can be accounted for. In'),\n",

Thus, it is essential that the supplier and the retailer \\ndevelop a relationship that allows trust to compensate for gaps in the contract. \\nThe relationship often develops initially between individuals that have been \\nassigned from each side. Over time, the informal understandings and commitments \\nbetween the individuals tend to be formalized when new contracts are drawn up. When \\ndesigning the partnership and initial contract, it should be understood that informal \\nunderstandings will operate side by side and these will contribute to the development \\nof the formal contract over time. Thus, contracts that evolve over time are likely to be \\nmuch more effective than contracts that are completely defined at the beginning of the \\npartnership. \\nOver the long term, contracts can only play a partial role in maintaining effective \\npartnerships in a supply chain. A good example is the relationship between Caterpillar \\nand its dealerships, in which either the dealer or Caterpillar can terminate agreements \\nwithout cause with 90 days\\' notice. Clearly it is not the contract alone that keeps the \\nrelationship effective. A combination of a contract, the mutual benefit of the relation\\xad\\nship, along with trust that compensates for gaps in the contract, results in effective sup\\xad\\nply chain partnerships. \\nDesigning Effective Conflict-Resolution Mechanisms \\nEffective conflict-resolution mechanisms can significantly strengthen any supply chain \\nrelationship.

The sharing of information over time helps move the relationship from \\ndeterrence-based trust to process-based trust. Once process-based trust is built \\nbetween the parties, it facilitates conflict resolution. \\nTo facilitate communication, frequent meetings should be held between managers \\nand staff assigned to the partnership. These meetings allow issues to be raised and dis\\xad\\ncussed before they turn into major conflicts. They also provide a basis for resolution at \\na higher level, should resolution not take place at the lower level. An important goal of \\nmeetings and other formal conflict-resolution mechanisms is to ensure that disputes \\nabout financial or technological issues do not turn into interpersonal squabbles. \\nWhen designing conflict-resolution mechanisms, it is important to be sensitive to \\nthe context of the partnership. In the United States, parties are sometimes comfortable \\nreturning to the detailed contract to resolve a dispute. The help of a court or an inter\\xad\\nmediary can also be sought to interpret the contract. Thus, detailed contracts can be \\nquite effective in the United States. In Asia, in contrast, conflict-resolution mechanisms \\ninvolving courts are unlikely to be very effective. Parties are much more comfortable \\nnegotiating resolutions to every conflict directly. Flexible contracts that allow for such \\nnegotiation are effective in building trust in that context. \\nMANAGING SUPPLY CHAIN RELATIONSHIPS \\nFOR COOPERATION AND TRUST \\nEffectively managed supply chain relationships foster cooperation and trust, thus \\nincreasing supply chain coordination. In contrast, poorly managed relationships lead to \\neach party being opportunistic, resulting in a loss of total supply chain profits. The man\\xad\\nagement of a relationship is often seen as a tedious and routine task. Top management, \\nin particular, is often very involved in the design of a new partnership but rarely \\ninvolved in its management. This has led to a mixed record in running successful supply \\nchain alliances and partnerships. \\nFigure 17-5 shows the basic process by which any supply chain partnership or \\nalliance evolves. Once the partnership has been designed and established, both part\\xad\\nners learn about the environment in which the partnership will operate, the tasks and \\nprocesses to be performed by each partner, the skills required and available on each \\nside, and the emerging goals of each side. The performance of each side is evaluated \\nbased on the improvement in profitability and on equity or fairness. At this stage, a bet\\xad\\nter evaluation of the value of the partnership becomes available, which provides both \\nparties in the supply chain partnership an opportunity to revise the conditions of the \\npartnership to improve profitability and fairness. It is important that the initial contracts be \\ndesigned with sufficient flexibility to facilitate such alterations. Formal contracts \\nmay be restructured to reflect the changes. As the business environment and company \\ngoals change, the cycle repeats itself and the relationship evolves. Any successful supply \\nchain partnership will go through many such cycles. \\nA supply chain partnership falters if the perceived benefit from the relationship \\ndiminishes or one party is seen as being opportunistic. Problems arise when communi\\xad\\ncation between the two parties is weak and the mutual benefit of the relationship is not \\nreiterated regularly. When managing a supply chain relationship, managers should \\nfocus on the following factors to improve the chances of success of a supply chain \\npartnership: \\n1. The presence of flexibility, trust, and commitment in both parties helps a supply \\nchain relationship succeed. In particular, commitment of top management on both \\nsides is crucial for success.'),\n",

The more fairly the stronger partner treats the weaker, vulnerable partner, the \\nstronger the supply chain relationship tends to be. \\nThe issue of fairness is extremely important in the supply chain context because \\nmost relationships involve parties with unequal power. Unanticipated situations that \\nhurt one party more than the other often arise. The more powerful party often has \\ngreater control over how the resolution occurs. The fairness of the resolution influ\\xad\\nences the strength of the relationship in the future. \\nThe relationship between Marks & Spencer and a manufacturer of a kitchen prod\\xad\\nuct provides an excellent example of a fair sharing of benefits.6 A few months after the \\nproduct's introduction, the manufacturer realized that costs had been miscalculated \\nand exceeded the price at which the product was being sold to Marks & Spencer. \\nMeanwhile, given its low retail price, customers found the product an outstanding \\nvalue and made it a big hit. When the manufacturer brought the problem to the atten\\xad\\ntion of Marks & Spencer, its managers helped the manufacturer reengineer both the \\nproduct and the process to lower cost. Marks & Spencer also lowered its margin to \\nprovide a sufficient profit for the manufacturer.

In the long run, \\nboth partners benefited and a higher level of trust developed. \\nProcedures and policies govern the interaction between parties in a supply chain \\nrelationship. It is thus important that the weaker party perceive the fairness of the \\nstronger party's procedures and policies for dealing with its partners. The stronger party \\nis in control of its policies and procedures and should not bias the policies in a way that \\nis opportunistic and does not benefit the entire supply chain. Fair procedures should \\nencourage two-way communication between the partners. The procedures should be \\nimpartial and should allow the weaker party an opportunity to appeal the stronger \\nparty's decisions. Finally, the stronger party should be willing to explain all its decisions. \\n17.6 CONTINUOUS REPLENISHMENT \\nAND VENDOR-MANAGED INVENTORIES \\nThe bullwhip effect can be dampened by practices that assign replenishment responsi\\xad\\nbility across the supply chain to a single entity. A single point of replenishment deci\\xad\\nsions ensures visibility and a common forecast that drives orders across the supply \\nchain. Two common industry practices that assign a single point of responsibility are \\ncontinuous replenishment programs and vendor-managed inventories. \\nIn continuous replenishment programs (CRP), the wholesaler or manufacturer \\nreplenishes a retailer regularly based on POS data. CRP may be supplier, distributor, \\nor third-party managed. In most instances CRP systems are driven by actual with\\xad\\ndrawals of inventory from retailer warehouses rather than POS data at the retailer \\nlevel. Tying CRP systems to warehouse withdrawals is easier to implement and retail\\xad\\ners are often more comfortable sharing data at this level. IT systems that are linked \\nacross the supply chain provide a good information infrastructure on which a continu\\xad\\nous replenishment program may be based. In CRP, inventory at the retaileris owned \\nby the retailer. \\nWith vendor-managed inventory (VMI), the manufacturer or supplier is responsi\\xad\\nble for all decisions regarding product inventories at the retailer. As a result, the con\\xad\\ntrol of the replenishment decision moves to the manufacturer instead of the retailer. In \\nmany instances of VMI, the inventory is owned by the supplier until it is sold by the \\nretailer. VMI requires the retailer to share demand information with the manufacturer \\nto allow it to make inventory replenishment decisions. VMI can allow a manufacturer \\nto increase its profits as well as profits for the entire supply chain if both retailer and \\nmanufacturer margins are considered when making inventory decisions. VMI also \\nhelps by conveying customer demand data to the manufacturer, which can then plan \\nproduction accordingly. This helps improve manufacturer forecasts and better match \\nmanufacturer production with customer demand. \\nVMI has been implemented with significant success by, among others, K-Mart \\n(with about 50 suppliers) and Fred Meyer. K-Mart has seen inventory turns on sea\\xad\\nsonal items increase from 3 to between 9 and 11, and for nonseasonal items from 12-15 \\nto 17-20. Fred Meyer has seen inventories drop by 30 to 40 percent while fill rates have \\nincreased to 98 percent. Other firms with successful implementations include \\nCampbell Soup, Frito-Lay, and Proctor & Gamble. \\nOne drawback of VMI arises because retailers often seU products from competing \\nmanufacturers that are substitutes in the customer's mind. For example, a customer may \\nsubstitute detergent manufactured by Proctor & Gamble with detergent manufactured\"),\n",

If the retailer has a VMI agreement with both manufacturers, each \\nmanufacturer will ignore the impact of substitution when making their inventory deci\\xad\\nsions. As a result, inventories at the retailer will be higher than optimal. In such a set\\xad\\nting, the retailer may be better positioned to decide on the replenishment policy. \\nAnother possibility is for the retailer to define a category leader from among the sup\\xad\\nplier and have the category leader manage replenishment decisions for all suppliers in \\nthe category. Wal-Mart follows such a practice and assigns a category leader for most of \\nits products. For example, HP was its category leader for printers and managed all \\nprinter replenishment. \\n17.7 COLLABORATIVE PLANNING, FORECASTING, \\nAND REPLENISHMENT (CPFR) \\nThe Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards Association (VICS) has defined \\nCPFR as \"a business practice that combines the intelligence of multiple partners in the \\nplanning and fulfillment of customer demand.\" According to VICS,since 1998, \"over \\n300 companies have implemented the process.\" In this section we describe CPFR and \\nsome successful implementations. It is important to understand that successful CPFR \\ncan only be built on a foundation in which the two parties have synchronized their data \\nand established standards for exchanging information. Much of the material in this sec\\xad\\ntion is an adaptation of material from the VICS Web site, www.vics.org/committees/cpfr. \\nSellers and buyers in a supply chain may collaborate along any or all of the follow\\xad\\ning four supply chain activities. \\n1. Strategy and planning. The partners determine the scope of the collaboration and \\nassign roles, responsibilities, and clear checkpoints. In a joint business plan they \\nthen identify significant events such as promotions, new product introductions, \\nstore openings/closings, and changes in inventory policy that affect demand and \\nsupply. \\n2. Demand and supply management. A collaborative sales forecast projects the part\\xad\\nners\\' best estimate of consumer demand at the point of sale. This is then converted \\nto a collaborative order plan that determines future orders and delivery require\\xad\\nments based on sales forecasts, inventory positions, and replenishment lead times. \\n3. Execution. As forecasts become firm, they are converted to actual orders. The ful\\xad\\nfillment of these orders then involves production, shipping, receiving, and stocking \\nof products. \\n4. Analysis. The key analysis tasks focus on identifying exceptions and evaluating \\nmetrics that are used to assess performance or identify trends. \\nA fundamental aspect of successful collaboration is the identification and resolu\\xad\\ntion of exceptions. Exceptions refer to a gap between forecasts made by the two sides \\nor some other performance metric that is falling or is likely to fall outside acceptable \\nbounds. These metrics may include inventories that exceed targets or product avail\\xad\\nability that falls below targets. For successful CPFR, it is very important to have a \\nprocess in place that allows the two parties to resolve exceptions. Detailed processes \\nfor identifying and resolving exceptions are discussed in the VICS CPFR Voluntary \\nGuidelines V 2.0 (2002). \\nOne successful CPFR implementation has involved Henkel, a German detergent \\nmanufacturer, and Broski, a Spanish food retailer. Prior to CPFR, Broski saw frequent \\nstockouts of Henkel products, especially during promotions. At the inception of CPFR \\n--------~---------·---\\n----\\nIT\" \\n~ \\n.i'),\n",

Within four \\nmonths of the CPFR implementation, however, 70 percent of the sales forecasts had \\nerrors under 20 percent and only 5 percent had errors over 50 percent. CPFR resulted \\nin a customer service level of 98 percent and an average inventory of only five days. \\nThis was accomplished despite 15 to 20 products being promoted every month. \\nAnother successful implementation involved Johnson & Johnson and Superdrug, a \\nchain in the United Kingdom. Over the three-month trial period beginning April 2000, \\nSuperdrug saw inventory levels at its DCs drop by 13 percent, while product availabil\\xad\\nity at its DCs increased by 1.6 percent. As reported by Steerman (2003), Sears and \\nMichelin also saw significant benefits from their CPFR initiative in 2001. In-stock lev\\xad\\nels at Sears improved by 4.3 percent, DCs-to-stores fill rate improved by 10.7 percent, \\nand overall inventory levels fell by 25 percent. \\nVICS has identified the four scenarios in Table 17-3 as the most common areas \\nwhere large-scale CPFR deployments have taken place between a retailer and a man\\xad\\nufacturer. \\nNext, we describe each of the four scenarios. \\nRETAIL EVENT COLLABORATION \\nIn many retail environments, such as supermarkets, promotions and other retail events \\nhave a significant impact on demand. Stock outs, excess inventory, and unplanned logis\\xad\\ntics costs during these events affect financial performance for both the retailer and the \\nmanufacturer. In such a setting, collaboration between retailers and suppliers to plan, \\nforecast, and replenish promotions is very effective. \\nRetail event collaboration requires the two parties to identify brands and specific \\nSKUs that are included in the collaboration. Details of the event such as timing, dura\\xad\\ntion, price point, advertising, and display tactics are shared. It is important for the \\nretailer to update this information as changes occur. Event-specific forecasts are then \\ncreated and shared. These forecasts are then converted to planned orders and deliver\\xad\\nies. As the event unfolds, sales are monitored to identify any changes or exceptions, \\nwhich are resolved through an iterative process between the two parties. \\nP&G has implemented some form of retail event collaboration with a variety of \\npartners including Wal-Mart. \\nDC REPLENISHMENT COLLABORATION \\nDC replenishment collaboration is perhaps the most common form of collaboration \\nobserved in practice and also the simplest to implement.

These forecasts are converted to a stream of orders from \\nthe DC to the manufacturer that are committed or locked over a specified time hori\\xad\\nzon. This information allows the manufacturer to build anticipated orders into future \\nproduction plans and build the committed orders on demand. The result is a reduction \\nin production cost at the manufacturer and a reduction of inventory and stockouts at \\nthe retailer. \\nDC replenishment collaboration is relatively easy to implement because it \\nrequires collaboration on an aggregate forecast and does not require sharing of \\ndetailed point-of-sale data. As a result, it is often the best scenario with which to start \\ncollaboration. Over time, this form of collaboration can be extended to include all stor\\xad\\nage points in the supply chain from retail shelves to raw material warehouses. \\nAccording to Hammond (1994), Barilla implemented this form of collaboration with \\nits distributors. \\nSTORE REPLENISHMENT COLLABORATION \\nIn store replenishment collaboration, trading partners collaborate on store-level point\\xad\\nof-sale forecasts. These forecasts are then converted to a series of store-level orders, \\nwith orders committed over a specified time horizon. This form of collaboration is \\nmuch harder to implement than a DC- level collaboration, especially if stores are small. \\nStore replenishment collaboration is easier for large stores such as Costco and Home \\nDepot. The benefits of store-level collaboration include greater visibility of sales for \\nthe manUfacturer, improved replenishment accuracy, improved product availability, \\nand reduced inventories. This form of collaboration is very beneficial for new products \\nand promotions. Manufacturers and their suppliers can use this information to \\nimprove operational execution. \\nCOLLABORATIVE ASSORTMENT PLANNING \\nFashion apparel and other seasonal goods follow a seasonal pattern of demand. Thus, \\ncollaborative planning in these categories has a horizon of a single season and is per\\xad\\nformed at seasonal intervals. Given the seasonal nature, forecasts rely less on histori\\xad\\ncal data and more on collaborative interpretation of industry trends, macroeconomic \\nfactors, and customer tastes. In this form of collaboration, the trading partners \\ndevelop an assortment plan jointly. The output is a planned purchase order at the \\nstyle/color/size level. The planned order is shared electronically in advance of a show, \\nwhere sample products are viewed and final merchandising decisions are made. The \\nplanned orders help the manufacturer purchase long-lead-time raw materials and \\nplan capacity. This form of collaboration is most useful if capacity is flexible enough to \\naccommodate a variety of product mix and raw materials have some commonality \\nacross end products. \\nORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS \\nFOR SUCCESSFUL CPFR \\nA successful CPFR implementation requires changes in the organizational structure and, \\nto be scalable, requires the implementation of appropriate technology. Effective collabo\\xad\\nration requires manufacturers to set up cross-functional, customer-specific teams that \\ninclude sales, demand planning, and logistics, at least for large customers. Such a focus \\nhas become feasible with the consolidation in retailing. For smaller customers such teams \\ncan be focused by geography or sales channel. Retailers should also attempt to organize \\nmerchandise planning, buying, and replenishment into teams around suppliers. This can be \\ndifficult given the large number of suppliers that consolidated retailers have. They can'),\n",

For retailers that \\nhave multiple levels of inventory such as DCs and retail stores, it is important to combine \\nthe replenishment teams at the two levels. Without collaborative inventory management \\nat the two levels, duplication of inventories is common.

CPFR technologies have been developed to facilitate sharing of forecasts \\nand historical information, evaluating exception conditions, and enabling revisions. \\nThese solutions must be integrated with enterprise systems that record all supply \\nchain transactions. \\nRISKS AND HURDLES FOR A CPFR IMPLEMENTATION \\nIt is important to realize that there are risks and hurdles for a successful CPFR \\nimplementation. Given the large-scale sharing of information, there is a risk of infor\\xad\\nmation misuse. Often one or both of the CPFR partners has relationships with the \\npartner's competitors. Another risk is that if one of the partners changes its scale or \\ntechnology, the other partner is forced to follow suit or lose the collaborative rela\\xad\\ntionship. Finally, the implementation of CPFR and the resolution of exceptions \\nrequire close interactions between two entities whose cultures may be very different. \\nThe inability to foster a collaborative culture across the partner organizations can be \\na major hurdle for the success of CPFR. One of the biggest hurdles to success is often \\nthat partners attempt something like store-level collaboration, which requires a \\nhigher organizational and technology investment. It is often best to start with some\\xad\\nthing like event-or DC-level collaboration, which is more focused and easier to col\\xad\\nlaborate on. One of the biggest hurdles for successful CPFR, however, is that \\ndemand information shared with partners is often not used within the organization \\nin an integrated manner. It is important to have integrated demand, supply, logistics, \\nand corporate planning within the organization to maximize the benefits of a CPFR \\neffort with a partner.\"),\n",

Much of what we have discussed in the various IT sections so far has elements of \\ncoordination-sharing forecasts, visibility of inventory levels, transmitting arrival \\ntimes-but much of what we have talked about has been internal supply chain opera\\xad\\ntions. In this chapter we are truly focusing on improving interenterprise operations. \\nAt the highest level, there are two ways in which IT can help to improve this area. \\nThe first is information availability. Significant benefit from interenterprise coordi\\xad\\nnation arises just from the sharing of information between companies. IT enables this \\nin two ways. The first is the actual physical sharing of this information. Through appli\\xad\\ncations that enable data to be viewed on the Internet to the integration of companies \\nsystems, IT provides the \"plumbing\" to make the actual sharing of information happen. \\nIT also helps in sorting these data and preparing them for viewing. The amount of \\ndata available is overwhelming and so just making the data visible to everyone is not \\nnecessarily helpful. IT structures the data and allows users to pull the figurative needle \\nout of the haystack of data through intelligent organization and searches. \\nThe second way that IT helps improve coordination is to use the visible informa\\xad\\ntion to make decisions. IT enables the use of supply chain information to make many \\nof the inventory, production, transportation, sourcing, and pricing decisions. \\nThere are perhaps more pitfalls in using IT for coordination than in any other \\narea. This is primarily because of the complexity and difficulty of the task at hand. \\nCertainly the technical challenges are significant. One example is the integration of \\ndisparate systems so that the information we discussed above is available to multiple \\nenterprises. Another problem is that different companies often have very different \\noperating processes. For coordination to be effective, these processes must somehow \\ninteract in a way that makes sense. Overcoming this problem within a company is diffi\\xad\\ncult, and it is even more so when more than one company is involved. However, the \\nbiggest hurdle to making these IT systems work is the trust factor that we have dis\\xad\\ncussed at length in this chapter. Companies that do not have a degree of trust in their \\ninteractions are very unlikely to get much in the way of benefit from investing in coor\\xad\\ndination software, regardless of how good the technology is. \\nThe major companies that provide software in this area are the supply chain soft\\xad\\nware providers from the ERP ranks such as SAP and Oracle and the best-of-players \\nsuch as i2 Technologies and Manugistics. This area is in some sense the youngest of all \\nthe software areas we have discussed. Few companies do this well, and most don\\'t do it \\nat all, so there may be the potential for new software companies to make headway in \\noffering products in this area. However, it is likely that the ERP players will firmly \\noccupy this space as it becomes more mature. \\n17.9 ACHIEVING COORDINATION IN PRACTICE \\n1. Quantify the bullwhip effect. Companies often have no idea that the bullwhip effect \\nplays a significant role in their supply chain. Managers should start by comparing the \\nvariability in the orders they receive from their customers with the variability in orders \\nthey place with their suppliers. This helps a firm quantify its own contribution to the \\nbullwhip effect. Once its contribution is visible, it becomes easier for a firm to accept \\nthe fact that all stages in the supply chain contribute to the bullwhip effect, leading to a \\nsignificant loss in profits. In the absence of this concrete information, companies try to'),\n",

This leads com\\xad\\npanies to invest significant amounts in inventory management and scheduling systems, \\nonly to see little improvement in performance or profits. Evidence of the size of the \\nbullwhip effect is very effective in getting different stages of the supply chain to focus \\non efforts to achieve coordination and eliminate the variability created within the sup\\xad\\nply chain. \\n2. Get top management commitment for coordination. More than any other aspect of sup\\xad\\nply chain management, coordination can succeed only with top management's commit\\xad\\nment. Coordination requires managers at all stages of the supply chain to subordinate \\ntheir local interests to the greater interest of the firm and even the supply chain. \\nCoordination often requires the resolution of trade-offs in a way that requires many \\nfunctions in the supply chain to change their traditional practices. These changes often \\nrun counter to approaches that were put in place when each function focused only on its \\nlocal objective. Such changes within a supply chain cannot be implemented without \\nstrong top management commitment. Top management commitment was a key factor in \\nhelping Wal-Mart and P&G set up collaborative forecasting and replenishment teams. \\n3. Devote resources to coordination. Coordination cannot be achieved without all parties \\ninvolved devoting significant managerial resources to this effort. Companies often do \\nnot devote resources to coordination because they either assume that lack of coordi\\xad\\nnation is something they have to live with or they hope that coordination will occur on \\nits own. The problem with this approach is that it leaves all managers involved with \\nonly the separate areas that they control, while no one is responsible for highlighting \\nthe impact one manager's actions have on other parts of the supply chain. One of the \\nbest ways to solve coordination problems is through teams made up of members from \\ndifferent companies throughout the supply chain. These teams should be made respon\\xad\\nsible for coordination and given the power to implement the changes required. Setting \\nup a coordination team is fruitless unless the team has the power to act, because the \\nteam will run into conflict with functional managers who are currently maximizing \\nlocal objectives. Coordination teams can be effective only once a sufficient level of \\ntrust builds between members from different firms. If they are used properly, coordina\\xad\\ntion teams can provide significant benefit, as has happened with the collaborative fore\\xad\\ncasting and replenishment teams set up by Wal-Mart and P&G. \\n4. Focus on communication with other stages. Good communication with other stages \\nof a supply chain often creates situations that highlight the value of coordination for both \\nsides. Companies often do not communicate with other stages of the supply chain and \\nare unwilling to share information. However, often all companies in the supply chain are \\nfrustrated by the lack of coordination and would be happy to share information if it \\nhelped the supply chain operate in a more effective manner. Regular communication \\namong the parties involved facilitates change in such a setting. For instance, a major PC \\ncompany had been ordering its microprocessors in batches of several weeks of produc\\xad\\ntion. It was trying to move to a build-to-order environment in which it would place \\nmicroprocessor orders on a daily basis. The PC company assumed that the microproces\\xad\\nsor supplier would be reluctant to go along with this approach. However, once communi\\xad\\ncation was opened up with the supplier, the opposite turned out to be true. The supplier \\nalso wanted to reduce lot sizes and increase the frequency of orders. It had just assumed \\nthat the PC manufacturer wanted large lots and thus never requested a change. Regular \\ncommunication helps different stages of the supply chain share their goals and identify \\ncommon goals and mutually beneficial actions that improve coordination. \\n5. Try to achieve coordination in the entire supply chain network. The full benefit of \\ncoordination is achieved only when the entire supply chain network is coordinated. It\"),\n",

Use technology to improve connectivity in the supply chain. The Internet and a \\nvariety of different types of software systems can be used to increase the visibility of \\ninformation throughout the supply chain. Until now, most IT implementations have \\nachieved visibility of information only within a firm. Visibility across the supply chain \\nstill requires additional effort in most cases. From the discussion in this chapter, it \\nshould be clear that the major benefits of IT systems can be realized only if the systems \\nhelp increase visibility across the supply chain and facilitate coordination. If firms are \\nto realize the full benefit of the huge investments they make in current IT systems, par\\xad\\nticularly ERP systems, it is crucial that they make the extra effort required to use these \\nsystems to facilitate collaborative forecasting and planning across the supply chain. \\nThe Internet should be used to share information and increase connectivity in the sup\\xad\\nply chain. The growth of Internet exchanges can be very effective in this regard. \\n7. Share the benifits of coordination equitably. The greatest hurdle to coordination in the \\nsupply chain is the feeling on the part of any stage that the benefits of coordination are \\nnot being shared equitably. Managers from the stronger party in the supply chain rela\\xad\\ntionship must be sensitive to this fact and ensure that all parties perceive that the way \\nbenefits are shared is fair. \\n17.10 SUMMARY OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES \\n1. Describe supply chain coordination and the bullwhip effect and their impact on supply chain \\nperformance. \\nSupply chain coordination requires all stages to take actions that maximize total supply \\nchain profits. A lack of coordination results if different stages focus on optimizing their local \\nobjectives or if information is distorted as it moves across the supply chain. The phenome\\xad\\nnon that fluctuation in orders increases as one moves up the supply chain from retailers to \\nwholesalers to manufacturers to suppliers is referred to as the bullwhip effect. The bullwhip \\neffect results in an increase in all costs in the supply chain and a decrease in customer service \\nlevels. The bullwhip effect moves all parties in the supply chain away from the efficient fron\\xad\\ntier and results in a decrease of both customer satisfaction and profitability within the supply \\nchain. \\n2. Identify causes of the bullwhip effect and obstacles to coordination in a supply chain. \\nA key obstacle to coordination in the supply chain is misaligned incentives that result in \\ndifferent stages optimizing local objectives instead of total supply chain profits. Other obsta\\xad\\ncles include lack of information sharing, operational inefficiencies leading to large replen\\xad\\nishment lead times and large lots, sales force incentives that encourage forward buying, \\nrationing schemes that encourage inflation of orders, promotions that encourage forward \\nbuying, and a lack of trust that makes any effort toward coordination difficult. \\n3. Discuss managerial levers that help achieve coordination in a supply chain. \\nManagers can help achieve coordination in the supply chain by aligning goals and incen\\xad\\ntives across different functions and stages of the supply chain. Other actions that managers \\ncan take to achieve coordination include sharing of sales information and collaborative fore\\xad\\ncasting and planning, implementation of single-point control of replenishment, improving \\noperations to reduce lead times and lot sizes, EDLP and other strategies that limit forward \\nbuying, and the building of trust and strategic partnerships within the supply chain. \\nIN~ \\nH if'),\n",

Describe actions that facilitate the building of strategic partnerships and trust within a sup\\xad\\nply chain. \\nA manager can help build trust and strategic partnerships by designing a relationship in \\nwhich the mutual benefit to both sides is clear, both parties are mutually interdependent, \\ncontracts are allowed to evolve over time, and conflicts are resolved effectively. When man\\xad\\naging the relationship, flexibility, information sharing, visibility of effort and performance of \\neach party, and fairness from the stronger party when distributing costs and benefits help \\nfoster trust and facilitate coordination in the supply chain. \\n5. Understand the different forms of CPFR possible in a supply chain. \\nPartners may set CPFR relationships to collaborate on store events, DC replenish\\xad\\nment, store replenishment, or assortment planning. DC replenishment collaboration is often \\nthe easiest to implement because it requires aggregate-level data. Store replenishment col\\xad\\nlaboration requires a higher level of investment in technology and data sharing to be suc\\xad\\ncessful. \\nDiscussion Questions \\nBibliography \\n1. What is the bullwhip effect and how does it relate to lack of coordination in a supply chain? \\n2. What is the impact of lack of coordination on the performance of a supply chain? \\n3. In what way can improper incentives lead to a lack of coordination in a supply chain? What \\ncountermeasures can be used to offset this effect? \\n4. What problems result if each stage of a supply chain views its demand as the orders placed \\nby the downstream stage? How should firms within a supply chain communicate to facilitate \\ncoordination? \\n5. What factors lead to a hatching of orders within a supply chain? How does this affect coor\\xad\\ndination? What actions can minimize large batches and improve coordination? \\n6. How do trade promotions and price fluctuations affect coordination in a supply chain? What \\npricing and promotion policies can facilitate coordination? \\n7. How is the building of strategic partnerships and trust valuable within a supply chain? \\n8. What issues must be considered when designing a supply chain relationship to improve the \\nchances of developing cooperation and trust? \\n9.

AI systems use algorithms and statistical models to analyze data, learn from it, and make decisions or predictions based on that data.\n",
      "There are several types of AI, including:\n",
      "1. Narrow or weak AI: This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition, language translation, or playing a game like chess or Go. Narrow AI systems are typically trained on large datasets and use machine learning algorithms to learn from that data.\n",

General AI systems would have the ability to reason, solve problems, and learn like a human, and would be able to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. However, it's important to note that we are still far from developing general AI.\n",
      "3. Superintelligence: This type of AI is significantly more intelligent than the best human minds. Superintelligence could potentially solve complex problems that are currently unsolvable, but it also raises concerns about safety and control.\n",
      "4. Artificial general intelligence (AGI): AGI refers to a hypothetical AI system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. AGI is considered the holy grail of AI research, but it remains an elusive goal.\n",
      "5. Cognitive computing: This type of AI refers to systems that mimic human thought processes, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and learning. Cognitive computing systems use machine learning algorithms and large datasets to simulate human cognition.\n",
      "6. Natural language processing (NLP): NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. NLP systems can understand, interpret, and generate human-like language, enabling applications such as chatbots, voice assistants, and language translation software.\n",
